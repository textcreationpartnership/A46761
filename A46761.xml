            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <salute>May it pleaſe Your Lordſhip,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THE general Decay and Contempt of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> amongſt us, has made me think, that I could not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter employ the Leiſure, which, by Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Favour, I enjoy, than in uſing my beſt Endeavours to ſhew the Excellency and the Certainty of it. And what I have done, is here humbly preſented to your Lordſhip, as of Right, and upon many Accounts, it ought to be.</p>
                  <p>The Honour and the Satisfaction which I have often had to hear Your Lordſhip ſpeak in the behalf of Religion and Virtue, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me to hope, that a Performance, though but ſuch as this, upon that Subject, may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your Acceptance. And the Name only
<pb facs="tcp:61773:3"/>of a Perſon of your Lordſhip's Honour, and Learning, and Knowledge of the World, may perhaps be of more advantage to the Cauſe I undertake, than any thing I have been able to write.</p>
                  <p>Religion may ſeem, by Deſcent, and as it were, by Inheritance, to belong to Your Lordſhip's Care: The Wiſdom and Piety of Your Great Anceſtor appear to diſtant Ages in the Reformation, which, through the Bleſſing of God, was in ſo great a meaſure, by His means, eſtabliſh'd in this Kingdom. And I have with Joy often thought, that I could obſerve the Spirit and Genius of my Lord Treaſurer <hi>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RGHLEY</hi> now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting it ſelf more than ever in your Noble Family. From whence, methinks, we may preſage Happineſs to the Nation, and may yet expect to ſee a true ſenſe of Religion revive, and may hope, that even in our days, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, amongſt <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> ſhall be more than a Name, which <hi>is every where ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An eminent Vertue is a Publick Good: There is a powerful and commanding Force in Great Examples, to countenance Vertue, and diſcourage Vice and Profaneneſs; to make Irreligion appear, as it is, baſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in the World; to degrade it, and thruſt it down among the lower and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught part of Mankind. Much is not to be expected from the Schools and from the
<pb facs="tcp:61773:3"/>Gown, under ſuch Contempt and Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. But the Great and the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble have it in their Power to do great things; things worthy of Themſelves, and for the Advancement of God's Glory. Perſons of High Birth, and both by Nature and Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fitted for the Higheſt Undertakings, whoſe Vertues ſhall flouriſh with their Years, and add New Luſtre to their Hereditary Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, may yet regain a due Eſteem to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and adorn the Goſpel of Chriſt. This is a proper Object for the Ambition of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous aſpiring Minds to expreſs their Gratitude to Him who has placed them ſo much above the reſt of the World; and when they find themſelves happy now, to diſdain to aim at any thing leſs than Everlaſting Happineſs hereafter. To be Miſerable after Happineſs, is an Aggravation of Miſery: But to receive Eternal Bleſſings, as the Fruits and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch as are Temporal, is the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of thoſe whom God has been pleaſed to diſtinguiſh from others by his Mercies, and who diſtinguiſh themſelves by a regard to his Honour and Service.</p>
                  <p>All that know <hi>Burghley,</hi> (and who is there almoſt that doth not know it?) are ſurpriſed with Wonder and Delight, to obſerve what Art can do, and to behold the Splendor and the Magnificence of Foreign Countries in our own: But the Glories and Rewards of Vertue ſhall continue, when <hi>Burghley</hi> it ſelf
<pb facs="tcp:61773:4"/>and the World ſhall be no more; and will make Death but a Paſſage and an Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from one Palace, from one Honour to another; and a Removal only from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Riches and imperfect Felicities of this Life, to the Manſions of Eternal Bliſs in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>That theſe my Endeavours may prove but in any meaſure ſerviceable to the Ends of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Virtue, and thereby to the Glory and Happineſs of your Honourable Family, in this and a better World, is, <hi>My Lord,</hi> the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Deſire and Prayer of,</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Am ſenſible, that the Publication of a Treatiſe of this nature, will be liable to Exceptions, from thoſe for whoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Benefit it is chiefly deſign'd, who will be ready to lay hold of all Pretences to avoid the being convinc'd of what they have ſo little mind to believe. They will be apt to ſay, That if the Truth of Religion be ſo certain, and ſo evident, as it is maintain'd to be, there could be little need of ſo many Diſcourſes upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for it is no ſign of Certainty, when tho' ſuch a number of Books are Publiſh'd of this kind, that ſo many Men of Learning and Parts have written upon the Subject, yet others, it ſeems, are not ſatisfy'd in their Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but are continually offering ſomething new upon it. They will likewiſe object, That many of the Profeſſors and Miniſters of Religion, do not live as if they believ'd themſelves, at leaſt, not as if they were ſo very certain of what they teach; and that if there were ſo great Certainty, there never could be ſo many <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:61773:5"/>but all who had heard of it, muſt needs be convinc'd by ſuch Evidence. I ſhall therefore ſhew here, That the Number of Books written on this Subject, doth not prove the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainty of Religion, but rather the contrary; and that the ill Lives of Men, is no Argument againſt the Religion they profeſs: And then I ſhall enquire how it comes to paſs, That a Religion, which carries ſo plain and convincing Evidence along with it, ſhould yet by too many be disbeliev'd, or diſregarded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1.</hi> To the Firſt Thing, it might be ſufficient to ſay, That the Number of Writers, is a great Confirmation of the Truth of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; ſince as many as have undertaken the Proof of it, have always agreed in the main Evidence, and differ only in Method, or in the Management of particular Arguments: And though all have not written with equal Strength and Clearneſs; yet there is not, I believe, one Author, but has brought ſufficient Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to confute the Adverſaries of Religion. They are pleas'd, indeed, to think otherwiſe: But they may at leaſt take notice, how obvious it is, that if this Objection prove any thing, it muſt prove, That there is no ſuch thing as <hi>Certainty</hi> in the World; becauſe there is no Art nor Science, concerning which divers Treatiſes are not daily Publiſh'd. But are therefore the Natures of Vertue and Vice uncertain? Is it the leſs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, whether Juſtice, Temperance, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Honeſty, be Vertues; or whether Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:61773:5"/>Adultery, and Theft, be Crimes; becauſe Laws are made, and Sermons daily preach'd concerning theſe Things? Or can any Man doubt, That theſe Crimes often meet with ſevere Puniſhments even in this World, though Men will take no Warning by never ſo many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, but have need of continual Advice and Exhortation to keep them from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of them? Is there the leſs Certainty in the Mathematicks, becauſe <hi>Euclid, Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and innumerable others, of all Ages and Nations, have put forth Books and Syſtems of Mathematicks in ſeveral Forms and Methods.</p>
                  <p>When many write upon the ſame Subject, it is an Argument of the Excellency and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of it; not that they are diſſatisfy'd in what has been already ſaid by others, but that they think more may be ſaid, or that ſome Things may be prov'd more clearly, in another Method, with more Advantage to ſome Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, and with greater Probability of remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Scruples of ſome Men. It is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, very fit, that all neceſſary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, upon which the Eternal Happineſs or Miſery of Mankind depends, ſhould be treated of in all kinds of Ways and Methods; and they cannot be too often diſcours'd of, nor by too many Men, that no Objection may remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwer'd, nor Scruple unobſerv'd. Though a <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> may be ſufficient, upon a plain Matter to wiſe Men; yet too much cannot be ſaid upon a Subject wherein all Men are concern'd: And it is the great
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:61773:6"/>Aſſurance of the Truth of Religion, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the Souls of Men, that has engag'd ſo many Authors in this Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the Primitive Fathers and Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts, Men of the greateſt Learning and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, in latter Ages, have undertaken this Subject, having made it their Study and Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to conſider the Grounds of our Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And I think few will pretend to more Judgment to diſcover Truth, or to more Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity to declare it, than ſuch Authors, who have had no particular Intereſt or Profeſſion in reference to Religion, but were under only the common Obligations of all Chriſtians; which if they had valu'd as little as ſome others, they could with as much Wit and Learning have appear'd in the Cauſe of Irreligion, as any that ever undertook it. Many of the moſt Eminent in all Profeſſions and Callings have been the moſt zealous Aſſertors of Religion; as I might ſhew by particular Examples which are in every Man's Memory. Indeed, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, few Men have ſo vain an Opinion of themſelves, as to think they underſtand their ſeveral Studies and Profeſſions better than ſuch Perſons who have given undoubted Evidence of their unfeigned Belief of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Men of the greateſt Sagacity and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have not been mov'd with ſuch Objections as others ſo much ſtumble at; but have liv'd and dy'd the Glory of their Age, and an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to their Religion; ſuch were the Learned
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:61773:6"/>Prince of <hi>Mirandula,</hi> and that Learned <hi>French</hi> Nobleman <hi>Mornaeus;</hi> ſuch were <hi>Grotius,</hi> Sir <hi>Matthew Hales,</hi> Dr. <hi>Willis;</hi> and many beſides, both of our own and other Nations. I ſhall mention but one more, who indeed was ſo Eminent, that I ſcarce need mention him, for he muſt be already in every Reader's Thoughts; I mean, the Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> who was as inquiſitive, and as unwilling to be impos'd upon, and knew as much of Nature, perhaps, as ever any Man, not Inſpir'd, did; and had withal as ſtedfaſt a Belief, and as aweful Apprehenſions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Religion; which he endeavour'd to Eſtabliſh and Propagate, not only by his own Writings, but by the Labours of others, which he Engag'd and rewarded by his Laſt Will and Teſtament.</p>

                     <hi>2.</hi> But Men do not always live anſwerably to what they profeſs to believe. It were heartily to be wiſh'd, that there had never been any Occaſion given for this Objection: For though it be very inconſiderable in it ſelf, yet it does, I believe, the moſt miſchief of any; becauſe Men naturally govern themſelves more by the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple than by the Judgment of others, or even than by their own Reaſon. But if we will judge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, the Example of one Man, who lives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrines of Religion, ought to be of more weight with us, than the Example of never ſo many, who live contrary to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Becauſe, when Men profeſs one thing,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:61773:7"/>and act another, their Actions are ſurely as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to be regarded as their Profeſſion: And if we will not believe their Profeſſion againſt their Actions, why ſhould we regard their Example againſt their avowed Principles and Profeſſion? It is in all other caſes eſteemed a good Argument for the Truth of any thing, when Men confeſs it againſt themſelves. And the Motives and Temptations are viſible, by which they are led aſide from their own declared Faith and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; this Pleaſure, or that Profit, is the cauſe of it, which every Man can point to. But when he, who lives conformably to his Principles, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies himſelf, when he loſes and ſuffers by it, he muſt needs be in great earneſt; whereas the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are apparently bribed, to forſake that in Practice, which, notwithſtanding, they cannot but own in the Theory and Principles.</p>
                  <p>This was an old Prejudice againſt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, That the Philoſophers did not obſerve their own Precepts. But it was rejected by wiſe Men, as no Argument againſt the Truth and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Philoſophy. It is a great Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Men, but ſure it can be no Argument againſt the Things themſelves, that they are diſregarded by thoſe who underſtand their worth, and pretend to have a due value and eſteem for them. And whoever renounces the Faith, or takes up Principles of Irreligion, becauſe of any ill Practices of others, too plainly declares ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that in Truth and Sincerity he never had any, or that he is very willing to part with his
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:61773:7"/>Religion. All Men make ſome pretence to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and thoſe Men moſt of all, who are ſo apt to decry Religion upon this account, That many who profeſs to believe it, do not always live up to its Rules and Inſtructions: But they do not conſider, in the mean time, That Men generally act as much againſt Reaſon as againſt Relgion; and that therefore this Objection, if it can ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie any thing, muſt baniſh all Reaſon and good Sence out of the World. If there be no True Religion, becauſe ſo few practiſe it as they ought; there can be no True Reaſon neither, becauſe the Lives of ſo many Men contradict it. And ſome, perhaps, would be contented, that there ſhould be no True Religion, rather than that there ſhould be no True Reaſon; becauſe then they muſt be no longer allowed to be able to Reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Religion.</p>
                  <p>But if the Truth and Reality of Things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Practice of Men, then the ſame Religion may be true and falſe at the ſame time; it may be true in one Age, and falſe in another; or true in one Countrey, and falſe in the next; and muſt be more or leſs true or falſe, in the ſame proportion, as the Lives and Manners of its Profeſſors are more or leſs vertuous or vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Indeed, this is ſo unreaſonable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt a Prejudice againſt Religion, though it be grown a very common one, that methinks every Man ſhould be aſhamed of it; eſpecially Men of Reaſon, who ſcorn ſo much, in all other caſes, to depend upon the Practice and Authority of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:61773:8"/>And it is hard to believe, that Men who think at all, can think as they ſpeak, when they make uſe of this Objection. Will any Man ſuppoſe, that Temperance doth not preſerve Health, tho' he ſhould ſee his Phyſician run into exceſs? or, that Poyſon will not kill, tho' the Man who tells him ſo, and adviſes him againſt it, be ſo deſperate as to take it himſelf?</p>
                  <p>But as abſurd as this Objection is in it ſelf, it is moſt of all abſurd, when it is urged againſt the Chriſtian Religion; of which we are aſſured, that one of the Twelve who firſt preached it, was an Apoſtate, and a Traytor: and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour declares, that many who had Preached and wrought Miracles in his Name, ſhould be at laſt rejected by him, <hi>Matth. vii. 21.</hi> And therefore, for any to make this cavil againſt Chriſtianity, is only to ſhew, that they do not conſider it, or will not remember the plaineſt and moſt remarkable Points of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3.</hi> The cauſes of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief amongſt Chriſtians, notwithſtanding the cleareſt Evidence for their Religion, are too many to be here recounted: But I ſhall mention ſome of the chief of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>(1.)</hi> Vicious Men are very unwilling to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Religion to be True, which is ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to their whole courſe of Life, and to all their Inclinations and Deſires, but they are very ready to catch at any Cavils and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences againſt it. The Lives of too many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have brought a Scandal, though a very unjuſt one, upon the Religion which they profeſs:
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:61773:8"/>and Men who find themſelves more enclined to do as they ſee them do, than as they hear them acknowledge they ought to do, make no ſufficient enquiry into the Principles of Religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>(2.)</hi> Divers Men have had a ſtrange Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſay ſomething new upon every Subject they treat of; and in order to that, have ſet themſelves with all their Skill and Power, to contradict and overthrow what has been ſaid by others, that they might make way for their own Opinions; or ſo to refine upon the Notions of others, that they might appear New, and of their own Invention: which has made inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Men conclude, that we are always to ſeek in our Doctrine, and have no fix'd Principles: whereas Men of Learning and Judgment know, that commonly what is with ſo much oſtentation propoſed and recommended to us for New, has been conſidered and rejected of old, though not, perhaps, in the very Terms, yet in the Sence and Subſtance of it; or elſe it is ſome True Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine under a different Form and Manner of Expreſſion.</p>
                  <p>The Improvements which have been made in Philoſophy, this laſt Age, afford a real and great advantage towards the Proof and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of Religion in Mens Minds; and yet there are few things which have been more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed to the Diſhonour of it. For when Men find it convenient to give ſome vent to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Humour, they bethink themſelves of a fit Subject for it to diſcharge it ſelf upon; and
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:61773:9"/>this muſt be ſomething Great, and ſomething that is very New and Surpriſing: and there is nothing which anſwers all theſe Qualities ſo well as a New Account of the Origin of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and then the Hiſtory of the Creation in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> as well as the World it ſelf, muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo all the Alterations which they are pleaſed to impoſe upon it, that it may perfectly ſubmit and comply with their New Hypotheſes. If this Fancy ſhould hold, New Syſtems of the World will be as common as New Romances: They muſt pardon me the Expreſſion; for <hi>Des Cartes</hi> himſelf, among his Friends, gave no better Name to his Syſtem; which was the firſt Ground and Occaſion to all the reſt. And nothing is more eaſie with a Philoſophical Wit, than to build or deſtroy a World: But it is to be hoped, when they have wearied themſelves with New Contrivances, they will let us have our Old World again. In the mean time, theſe Men, who have too much Philoſophy to have no Religion, put dangerous Weapons into the Hands of thoſe who have neither the one nor the other, and know not how to uſe them but to do miſchief. And there is nothing ſo plain, but it may be rendred diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and obſcure to many Men, by long and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Diſputes. If great numbers of Men ſhould write concerning the Sun's Heat and Light, and Motion for many Years, and every one ſhould ſtill contradict all that went before him, and ſtrive to ſay ſomething New and Strange upon the Subject; the laſt, for ought I know,
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:61773:9"/>might pretend to prove that perhaps there may be no Sun at all: Which, indeed, is no more than what the Scepticks have ſaid. And this Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and Scepticiſm concerning God, and his Providence, and Revelation, muſt end in the Scepticiſm of our very Senſes, if theſe Principles be purſued in their direct and unavoidable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences.</p>
                  <p>Others have been too bold with the Myſteries of Religion, and have pretended to explain them ſo far, as if they would endeavour to preſent us with a Religion without all Myſtery, which at the ſame time has expoſed Themſelves to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and Religion to the Scorn of ſuch as are glad to take all occaſians to ſhew their Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to it. The evident and declared Deſign of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> is, to retain no Myſteries, but by forced Interpretations of Scripture to expound them all to their own, that is, to a new and abſurd ſence; and it is but too plain, that there is a combined Deſign carried on between Them and the Deiſts who are contented to paſs for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, with a Diſtinction, and without a Myſtery: <hi>Anti-Trinitarian</hi> is a milder word than <hi>Anti-Chriſtian,</hi> and <hi>Unitarian</hi> is but a different Name for <hi>Deiſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another ſort have been very laborious in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Myſteries, where there are none; and under a pretence of reducing the plaineſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines to clear Principles, have only am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ſed and confounded Men in the true and obvious No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them. Thus the Duties of Love to God and to our Neighbour, are plain in themſelves, and
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:61773:10"/>are as plainly ſet down in the Scriptures: And to raiſe Abſtracted and Metaphyſical Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon ſo plain Texts, is only to tell us what we know before, in other and leſs intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Terms, or elſe to fall into the nice and raſh Diſputes of the School-Men, or into the Enthuſiaſtick Heats of the Myſtical Divines; which can have no Tendency to the Peace or Edification of the Church, but gives an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the Adverſary to Blaſpheme.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>(3.)</hi> A Third Cauſe of Infidelity, has been the Raſhneſs of ſome Criticks. For if any thing relating to Religion has been once call'd in Queſtion, by Men who have got themſelves a Name, by writing more boldly than wiſer Men have done, the Authority of ſuch Men ſhall be thought a ſufficient Anſwer to all the Arguments which can be taken from any thing which they are pleas'd to diſlike. Criticiſm, when it falls to the ſhare of a prudent Man, is, without doubt, a neceſſary and moſt valuable Part of Learning: But it muſt be confeſs'd, that there is hardly any thing more impertinent than an impertinent Critick. It is a great thing, if it be well conſider'd, to ſet the Bounds and fix the Territories of Learning, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge to every Author his own Works, and ſay, that this Book, or perhaps ſome ſmall Part of a Book, ſhall be his, and the other he ſhall have nothing to do withal. This is no trivial Matter, nor of ſmall Conſequence, and ought not to be at the pleaſure of any one, who
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:61773:10"/>has a mind to be taken notice of, for contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting the receiv'd Opinion, and being more confident than others. And the leſs Occaſion there is for theſe Criticks, the more Danger there is from them, for if there be no Work for them, they will be apt to make themſelves Work: And what Author will be able to ſtand before Men, whoſe Buſineſs and Ambition it is to find Fault? But though the Juriſdiction of Criticks be very large and abſolute: Yet I have taken care not to come under it, but have purpoſely avoided inſiſting upon any Authorities which have faln under their Diſputes, unleſs it be, perhaps, in ſpeaking of the <hi>Sibyls;</hi> but there I have the Conſent of the beſt Criticks; beſides evident Reaſon, on my ſide, ſo far as I am concern'd for them.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>(4.)</hi> A Pretence to Miracles and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, without Reaſon or Ground for it, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of ſome particular Errors, has weaken'd the Belief of the True Miracles and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: And whilſt laborious Endeavours have been us'd to ſhew that the Chriſtian Religion cannot be true, unleſs thoſe Doctrines be true, which have no Foundation in it; the quite contrary has happen'd to what in Charity we muſt ſuppoſe theſe Authors deſign'd: For inſtead of owning their Religion to be true; Men, who are convinc'd of the Weakneſs of their Pretences, have taken them at their Word, and have been forward to grant them, That there is no Religion True, and therefore not theirs.</p>
                  <pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:61773:11"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>5.</hi> I ſhall ſhew at large, in due time, That the many Differences and Diſputes in Religion, are no prejudice to the Truth and Certainty of it; but they are, notwithſtanding, a great ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal and temptation, and a great hindrance to the Salvation of Men, eſpecially as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly managed; whilſt by all imaginable Arts and Means, Men of different Parties and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ſtrive to run down their Adverſaries. Thoſe who are concerned, would do well, I ſhould think, to conſider what miſchief may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, through the imprudent and unchriſtian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Diſputes, even in a right Cauſe; which has no need of ſuch methods; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are the leſs excuſable, who uſe them in defence of ſuch a Cauſe. If we would convince or perſuade Men in any other thing, we never are wont to think it a proper expedient to uſe them ill, and give them hard words: And is rough <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage proper only for the propagation of the Doctrines of the Goſpel, and of a Religion of Peace, and Meekneſs, and Charity?</p>
                  <p>I know what Examples may be produced to countenance this Practice; but thoſe great Authors have Excellencies enough for our imitation, we need not imitate their Faults. Our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, indeed, himſelf, and his Apoſtles, did not always forbear ſevere language; but then they ſpoke with a Divine Power and Authority, and knew how to ſpeak to the Hearts, as well as to the Ears of Men, and fully perceived when this was the laſt and only Remedy to be uſed;
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:61773:11"/>they could ſtrike dead with their Words, and were infallible in the uſe of ſuch Expreſſions as were proper for the preſent occaſion, either to comfort or to terrifie Sinners, and awaken them to Repentance. There is no doubt, but a ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Reproof or Rebuke, though it be very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, may be not only conſiſtent with Charity, but may alſo be the Effect of it; and if ever we may ſpeak with the Power and Authority, as well as in <hi>the meekneſs and gentleneſs of Chriſt,</hi> we muſt do it when the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion is called in queſtion, and that by Chriſtians. We live in an Age in which Men think they have done a great thing, and enough for them to value themſelves upon, if they can but ſtart a bold Objection againſt the Scriptures, though it have never ſo little ſence in it. We have ſufficient warrant to treat theſe Men as they deſerve: for the Apoſtles were commanded (according to a Cuſtom in uſe amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi>) to <hi>ſhake off the duſt off their feet,</hi> againſt ſuch as rejected their Doctrine: and the leaſt we can ſay to them, is to let them know, that if they will not believe, we are ſorry for it, but cannot help it, and that they will have the worſt of it. Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> himſelf will allow, that an Atheiſt ought to be baniſh'd as a Publick Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and ſcarce any Terms can be too ſevere for thoſe who openly apoſtatize from the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in which they have been baptized, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme that Holy Name by which they are called.
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:61773:12"/>We muſt not ſo debaſe the Goſpel of Chriſt, as to ſeem to beg their Approbation, which, I'm ſure, we have little need of, in the preſent caſe. I am far from thinking any thing ſmall or inconſiderable, in which the Honour of God, and the Truth of Religion is concern'd; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a great diſtinction is to be made between them from whom we differ in particular Points, though of great moment and conſequence, and thoſe who rejct the Whole. Our chief Zeal and Strength ſhould be employed againſt the Common Enemies, who delight in our Quarrels, and ſport themſelves with the mutual Wounds we ſo freely give one another.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <hi>(9.)</hi> We have a ſort of Men amongſt us, who from hence have taken occaſion to make it their whole Buſineſs, both by their Diſcourſes and Writings, to laugh all Religion and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality out of the World: which has made our very Wit to degenerate, though this be the only thing for which theſe Men ſeem to value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and our Poems, with all their ſoft Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and flowing Style, to be far from deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Commendation: for this way of Writing is as much againſt the Rules of Poetry, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe of Vertue; and they can never an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it to their own Art, whatever they may do to their Conſciences; but ought to be cenſured for being ill Poets, as well as ill Men. A fine Saying, a ſoft or bold Expreſſion, or a pretty Character! is this all we have in exchange for our Reaſon and Religion, which theſe Men
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:61773:12"/>have ſo laboriouſly decryed! Some of the beſt Poets of our Age have been ſo ſenſible of the Diſhonour hereby done to God, the Diſſervice to Mankind, and the Diſgrace to ſo Noble an Art, that they have employed their Genius a better way. But the extravagant Raillery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Religion has been the more licentious, and the more frequent, not only becauſe it has met with Applauſe from ſo many, who are none of the wiſeſt part of Mankind, but becauſe it is the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt way of Wit, flowing ſo naturally from the very Temper and Inclination of corrupted Minds; and any ſmart Reflection may eaſily be taken from another Subject, and applied here with advantage, becauſe it looks more extravagant and daring, and ſurpriſeth for no other reaſon, but for the bold irreverent uſe of it. What is there in Religion, if it were untrue, that can ſeem ridiculous? What, in the aweful Majeſty of the Lord of Heaven and Earth, that can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke the Laughter and Mockery of any but Fools and Mad-men? It is not obvious to conceive, why it ſhould be thought a greater argument of a Man's Parts, to revile his God, than his Prince; to ſpeak Blaſphemy, than it is to ſpeak Treaſon; or why the Wit ſhould atone for the Crime more in the one caſe than in the other. But the truth is, a very moderate ſhare of that will ſerve the turn in both caſes. <hi>Produce your cauſe, ſaith the Lord; bring forth your ſtrong reaſons, ſaith the God of Jacob.</hi>

For whenever the World had been created, there muſt have been a time when it had exiſted but Six Thouſand Years; and then the ſhortneſs of the <hi>Epocha</hi> might have been objected, as well as now. So that there was no Poſſibility of preventing this Objection, unleſs the World could have been Eternal; which was likewiſe impoſſible, from the Nature of Time, which being ſucceſſive, neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a Beginning; and as this Author, by his Tranſlator, ſpeaks in that Place, <hi>We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not form to our ſelves any Idaea of a Thing created from Eternity.</hi> But what is cited out of either of theſe Authors, will fall under ſome of the Heads which are to be treated of in another Book which I deſign upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; I ſhall therefore here only ſingle out ſuch

                     </note> That <hi>the Epicurean Deiſts labour to have their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces imputed rather to a Superiority of their Reaſon above that of others, than to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude of their Reaſon to their own Paſſions; which ſhews, Vice is naturally eſteemed a baſe and low thing.</hi> It is but too plain, that this was his own caſe, as his unhappy Death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>

                  <p>The Eſſence of all Matter muſt be the ſame, whether Extenſion, or any thing elſe, be aſſign'd as the Eſſence of it; and though we may be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Eſſence of Matter, yet we know it cannot be eſſential to it to Think: for then all Matter would neceſſarily Think.

                     <hi>Bulk</hi> of Matter could produce Thought in it, and the Subtile Matter ſhould be able to Think and Reaſon, though the Groſs cannot; then the Parts of a Stone would think, when it is ground to Duſt; though when they are joined and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted together, they make up a Body, as unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to think, as any thing we can imagine. If <hi>Reſt</hi> could cauſe Matter to think, a Stone would be the moſt thinking Creature in the World. If <hi>Motion</hi> could cauſe it, then that which moves with moſt quickneſs, would think moſt, as Fire, and the Sun, and Stars: but Motion is only a ſucceſſive change of Place, and there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why Matter ſhould think in one place, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than in another; or why it ſhould think, when it is moved in a Right Line, or in a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, or in any Curve Line, rather than when it lies ſtill. Again, There is no reaſon why Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould be able to think, or not think, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its <hi>Situation</hi> or Poſition; why it ſhould think in the Brain, rather than upon the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher; or when it is digeſted, and reduced to Animal Spirits, rather than when it is in a more compacted Subſtance, and has a different relation to the parts of Matter about it. Laſtly, If any ſort of <hi>Figure</hi> could produce Thought, Stones muſt certainly think, as well as the beſt of us; and ſo, indeed, might any thing elſe: for what Body is there that may not ſubſiſt under all varieties of Figure?</p>
                  <p>Neither can any lucky conjuncture of all theſe together produce a Power and Faculty of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:61773:18"/>For, imagine what Bulk, Reſt or Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Situation and Figure you can, to meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they are all alike uncapable of ſo much as one Thought; ſince there is nothing in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of any of theſe Accidents or Modifications of Matter, but it is as far from any Power of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as Matter it ſelf is; and therefore Thinking can no more ariſe from a combination of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, than it can proceed from the amaſſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of Matter. All the Accidents, but Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have nothing Active or Operative in them, but are only Matter under different Modes and Relations. And Motion, whatever the Figure, or Bulk and Contexture of any Body may be, can be but Motion ſtill: and ſuppoſe what Contexture or Modifications you will; what is Motion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all Determinations, Colliſions and Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, but change of Place? And, how can change of Place produce Thinking, under any variety of Contexture in the Particles of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; Free-will is impoſſible to be accounted for by Matter and Motion, as <hi>Epicurus</hi> found, who was therefore forced to have recourſe to his <hi>Declinationes Atomorum;</hi> for which he is ſo juſtly expoſed by <hi>Tully.</hi> For neither can Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter determine its own Motion, nor can Motion determine it ſelf, but muſt be determined by ſomething External; whereas all men find it in their power to determine themſelves by an Inward and voluntary Principle.</p>
                  <p>It is true, indeed, that the Soul, in its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, depends very much upon the Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:61773:19"/>of the Body: yet the Soul, even in this ſtate, has Thoughts, which have no Relation to the Body, or any Material Thing; as Thoughts of God and Spirits, its own Reflex Thoughts, or Conſciouſneſs of its own Operations. And if it were now capable of no Thoughts, but ſuch as have ſome dependance upon the Body; yet this can never prove, that the Soul it ſelf is Material, or that Matter Thinks. A Man writes with his Pen, and cannot write without one; Is it therefore his Pen properly that writes, and not the Man? The Body is the Inſtrument of the Soul, in its Operations here; and as the Inſtrument is fit or unfit, ſo muſt its Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be more or leſs perfect.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>it is ſtrange, that the chief part of us ſhould be of ſuch a Nature, that we can form no</hi> Idaea <hi>of it.</hi> We may form an <hi>Idaea</hi> of it, though but an imperfect one: And do we not know, that the Eye, the noblest part of the Body, cannot ſee it ſelf, but imperfectly, and by Reflexion? And let any Man try, whether he can form a better Idea of a Materal Soul, than of an Immeterial one. But this Writer, by <hi>Idaea,</hi> ſeems to mean a Material Idea, or Imagination: and we cannot, indeed, form a material Idea of an Immaterial Spirit. Yet, after all which he, or any Man elſe, has ſaid, the Nature of the Soul is as clearly underſtood, as that of the Body: and there is nothing encumbred with greater Difficulties than Extenſion, if that be the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Matter; and if that be not, it is as hard ſtill to know what the Eſſence of Matter is.
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:61773:19"/>The Inſtance which he brings of <hi>Brutes,</hi> is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered, Whether they can think, or not. If they cannnot, the Objection falls of it ſelf: If they can, I ſhould rather ſuppoſe, that their Souls may be annihilated, or may tranſmigrate and paſs from one Brute to another, than that the Souls of Men muſt be Material, that the Souls of Brutes may be Material too.</p>

But though I have, upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, mention'd this Gentleman here; yet it would be a great Injury done him, to rank him with the Authors of <hi>The Oracles of Reaſon.</hi>

                  <p>There is prefix'd to the Pieces, an Account of the Life and Death of that unhappy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Mr. <hi>Blount,</hi> with a pretence to vindicate his Murther of himſelf, becauſe his deceaſed Wife's Siſter refuſed to be marry'd to him; by all the Topicks and Arguments of Reaſon and Philoſophy. Which is ſuch an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking, as I am confident was never heard of before, to prove, that a Man may very gravely and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophically kill himſelf, if a Woman, whom he ought not to marry, will not be his Wife. It is ſtrange to ſee, that Men ſhould think it fit to vent ſuch things as theſe in the Face of the World: but this diſcovers the <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of theſe Men, and is a fit Preface to ſuch a Book. <hi>This Wiſdom deſcendeth not from Above.</hi> Behold the Men in their Principles and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:61773:20"/>the demure Pretenders to Humane Reaſon, and Moral Vertue, and the Enemies of Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion!</p>
                  <p>We are fallen into an Age, in which there are a ſort of Men who have ſhewn ſo great a forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be no longer Chriſtians, that they have catch'd at all the little Cavils and Pretences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Religion; and, indeed, if it were not more out of charity to their own Souls, than for any credit Religion can have of them, it were great pity but they ſhould have their Wiſh: for they both think and live ſo ill, that it is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for the goodneſs of any Cauſe, that they are againſt it. It was urged, as a confirmation of the Chriſtian Riligion, by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that it was haved and perſecuted by <hi>Nero,</hi> the worſt of Men: And I am confident, it would be but ſmall Reputation to it, in any Age, if ſuch Men ſhould be found of it. They ſpeak evil of the things they underſtand not; and are wont to talk with as much confidence againſt any point of Religion, as if they had all the Learning in the World in their keeping, when commonly they know little or nothing of what has been ſaid for that againſt which they diſpute. They ſeem to imagine, that there is nothing in the World, beſides Religion, that has any difficulty in it: but this ſhews how little they have conſidered the Nature of Things, in which multitudes of Objections and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties meet an obſerving Man in every Thought. And after all, Religion has but one fault (as they account it) which they have been able to
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:61773:21"/>diſcover in it, and that is, that it is too good and vertuous for them; for when they have ſaid all they can, this is their great quarrel againſt it; and (as it has been truly obſerved) no cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity leſs than that of the Religion which they deſpiſe, would have much care or conſideration for them.</p>
                  <p>Thus have ſome Men diſhonoured Religion by their Lives; ſome by an affectation of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty; ſome by invalidating the Authority of Books relating true Miracles and Prophecies, and others by forging falſe ones: ſome again, by their too eager and imprudent Diſputes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions about Religion, whilſt from hence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have taken the liberty to ridicule it, and to diſpute againſt it, but ſo as to expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whilſt they would expoſe Religion. And thus has the cleareſt and moſt neceſſary Truth been obſcured and deſpiſed, whilſt it has been betrayed by the vanity and quarrels of its Friends, to the ſcorn and weakneſs of its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                  <p>However, in all their oppoſition and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to Revealed Religion, I find it aſſerted by theſe Men, that Atheiſm is ſo abſurd a thing, that they queſtion whether there ever were, or can be an Atheiſt in the World. I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here proved, from the Attributes of God, and the Grounds of Natural Religion, that the Chriſtian Religion muſt be of Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that this Religion is as certainly true, as it is, that God Himſelf exiſts; which is the
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:61773:21"/>plaineſt Truth, and the moſt univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged of any thing whatſoever. And becauſe there is nothing ſo true or certain, but ſomething may be alledged againſt it, I ſhall beſides diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon ſuch Heads as have been moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt: In which I ſhall endeavour to prove the Truth in ſuch a manner, as to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate it againſt all Cavils; though I ſhall not take notice of particular Objections, which is both a needleſs and indeed an endleſs labour, for there is no end of Cavils: but if the Truth be well and fully explained, any Objection may receive a ſufficient Anſwer, from the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Doctrine againſt which it is urged, by applying it to particular Difficulties; as one Right Line is enough to demonſtrate all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations from it to be Crooked.</p>
                  <p>It is very eaſie to cavil and find fault with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing; and to ſtart Objections, and ask Queſtions, is even to a Proverb eſteemed the worſt ſign that can be of a great Wit, or a ſound Judgment. Men are unwilling to believe any thing to be true, which contradicts their Vices; and the weakeſt Arguments, with ſtrong Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to a Cauſe, will prove or diſprove whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they have a mind it ſhould. But let Men firſt practiſe the Vertues, the Moral Vertues, which our Religion enjoins, and then let them diſprove it if they can: nay, let them diſprove it now, if they can, for it ſtands in no need of their favour; but, for their own ſakes, let them have a care of miſtaking Vices for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:61773:22"/>and every profane Jeſt for a Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I wiſh they would conſider, whether the Concern they have, to ſet up Natural againſt Revealed Religion, proceed not from hence, that, by Natural Religion, they mean no more than juſt what they pleaſe themſelves, or what they judge convenient in every caſe or occaſion: whereas Revealed Religion is a fix'd and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined thing, and preſcribes certain Rules and Laws for the Government of our Lives. The plain truth of the matter, is, that they are for a Religion of their own contrivance, which they may alter as they ſee ſit; but not for one of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, which will admit of no change, but muſt always continue the ſame, whatever they can do. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs that were the caſe, there would be little occaſion to trouble them with Books of this kind; for the Arguments brought againſt the Chriſtian Religion, are indeed ſo weak and inſignificant, that they rather make for it; and it might well be ſaid, as M. <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal</hi> relates, by one of this ſort of Men, to his Companions, <hi>If you continue to diſpute at this rate, you will certainly make me a Chriſtian.</hi> I ſhall venture, at leaſt, to ſay of this Treatiſe, in the like manner as he doth of his, That if theſe Men would be pleaſed to ſpend but a little of that time, which is ſo often worſe employed, in the peruſal of what is here offered, I hope that ſomething they may meet withal, which may ſatisfie their Doubts, and convince them of their Errors.</p>
                  <pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:61773:22"/>
                  <p>But though they ſhould deſpiſe whatever can be ſaid to them, yet there are others, beſides the profeſs'd Adverſaries of Revealed Religion, to whom a Treatiſe of this nature may be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable. The truth is, notwiſtanding the great Plainneſs of the Chriſtian Religion, I cannot but think, that Ignorance is one chief cauſe why it is ſo little valued and eſteemed, and its Doctrines ſo little obeyed: A great part of Chriſtians content themſelves with a very ſlight and imperfect Knowledge of the Religion they profeſs; and are able to give but very little Reaſon for that, which is the moſt Reaſonable thing in the World; but they profeſs it rather as the Religion of their Country, than of their own choice; and becauſe they find it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts their ſenſual Deſires, they are willing to believe as little of it as may be; and when they hear others cavil and trifle with it, partly out of Ignorance, and partly from Inclination, they take every idle Objection, if it be but bold enough, for an unanſwerable Argument. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if Chistians were but throughly acquainted with the Grounds of their Religion, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely diſpoſed to believe and practiſe according to them, they would be no more moved with theſe Cavils, than they would be perſuaded to think the worſe of the Sun, if ſome Men ſhould take a fanſie to make that the Subject of their Railery. To have the more doubtful and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering thoughts of Religion, becauſe it is expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the ſcorn and contempt of ill Men, is as
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:61773:23"/>if we ſhould deſpiſe the Sun for being under a Cloud, or ſuffering an Eclipſe; not knowing that he retains his Light, and Religion its Excellency ſtill, though we be in darkneſs; the Light may be hid from us, but can loſe nothing of its own Brightneſs, though we ſuffer for want of it, and lie under the <hi>ſhadow of Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Conſideration of the Grounds and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of our Religion is uſeful to all ſorts of Men: for if ever we will be ſeriouſly and truly Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, we muſt lay the foundation of it in our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, that, by the rational conviction of our Minds, we may (through the Grace of God aſſiſting us) bring our Wills to a ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and our Affections to the obedience of the Goſpel of Chriſt; and the more we think of, and conſider theſe things, the more we ſhall be convinced of them, and they will have the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power and influence in the courſe of our Lives. For tho' the Truth of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion cannot, without great ſin and ignorance, be doubted of by Chriſtians; yet it is a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to our Faith, and adds a new Life and Vigour to our Devotions, when we recollect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what good Reaſons we are Chriſtians, and are not ſuch by Cuſtom and Education only, but upon Principles which we have throughly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and muſt abide by, unleſs we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce our Reaſon with our Religion.</p>
                  <p>And what Subject can be more uſeful, or more worthy of a rational and conſidering Man's Thoughts? Theſe things, which are now made
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:61773:23"/>matter of Cavil and Diſpute, will be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Contemplation, and of our Joy and Happineſs to all Eternity in the other World. We ſhall then have clear and diſtinct apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Means and Methods of our Salvation, and ſhall for ever admire and adore the Divine Wiſdom, in the Conduct and Diſpoſal of thoſe very Things about which we now are moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd.</p>

                     <p>IN Diſcourſing of the <hi>Reaſonableneſs and Certainty of the Chriſtian Religion,</hi> I ſhall uſe this Method: I. I ſhall ſhew, That from the Notion of a God, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follows, That there muſt be ſome Divine Revelation. II. I ſhall enquire into the Way and Manner by which this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation may be ſuppos'd to be deliver'd and preſerv'd in the World. III. I ſhall ſhew,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61773:32"/>That from the Notion of a God, and the Nature and Deſign of a Divine Revelation, it follows, That the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament are that Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. IV. That no other Books or Doctrines whatſoever can be of Divine Revelation. V. I ſhall from hence give a Reſolution of our Faith, by ſhewing, That we have the ſame Evidence for the Truth and Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scriptures, that we have for the Being of God himſelf; becauſe it follows, from the Notion of a God, both that there muſt of neceſſity be ſome Divine Revelation, and that the Scriptures are that Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. VI. Having done this, I ſhall, in the laſt Place, endeavour to clear ſuch Points as are commonly thought moſt liable to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in the Chriſtian Religion; and ſhall propoſe ſome Conſiderations, which may ſerve to remove ſuch Objections, and obviate ſuch Cavils as are uſually rais'd againſt the Holy Scriptures.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>IN the firſt Place, I ſhall ſhew how Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and Neceſſary it is to ſuppoſe, That God ſhould Reveal himſelf to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: And I ſhall inſiſt the rather upon this, becauſe it is not uſually ſo much conſider'd in this Controverſie as it ought to be; for if it were, it certainly would go very far towards the proving the Divine Authority of the Scriptures; ſince if it be once made appear that there muſt be ſome Divine Revelation, it would be no hard Matter to prove that the Scriptures are that Revelation: For if it be prov'd that there muſt be ſome Revealed Religion, there is no other which can bear any Competition with that contain'd in the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament. My firſt Buſineſs therefore ſhall be to ſhew, from the Conſideration of the Attributes of God, and of the Nature and State of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that in all Reaſon we cannot but believe that there is ſome Revealed Religion in the World.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing more evident to Natural Reaſon, than that there muſt be ſome Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more abſurd, than to imagine that that wonderful Variety of Beings in the Heavens and Earth and Seas, which all the Wiſdom of Man is not able in any Meaſure to underſtand, or throughly to ſearch into, ſhould yet be produc'd and continu'd for ſo many Thouſand Years together, without any Wiſdom or Contrivance; that an unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Concourſe of Atoms, which could never build the leaſt Houſe or Cottage, ſhould yet build and ſuſtain the wonderful Fabrick of the whole World; that when the very Lines in a Globe or Sphere cannot be made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Art, the World it ſelf, which that is but an imperfect Imitation of, ſhould be made without it, and that leſs Skill ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd to the forming of a Man, than is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the making of his Picture; that Chance ſhould be the Cauſe of all the Order, and Fortune of all the Conſtancy and Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity in the Nature of Things; and that the very Faculties of Reaſon and Underſtanding in all Mankind, ſhould have their Original from that, which had no Senſe or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but was meer Ignorance and Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. This is ſo far from being Reaſon and Philoſophy, that it is down-right Folly and Contradiction.</p>
                        <p>From a Being therefore of infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection muſt proceed all things that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61773:33"/>with all their Perfections and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, and among others, the Virtues and Excellencies of Wiſdom, Juſtice, Mercy and Truth muſt be deriv'd from him, as the Author of all the Perfections of which the Creatures are capable. And it is abſurd to imagine that the Creator and Governor of the World, who is infinitely more Juſt, more Wiſe and Good and Holy than any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can be, will not at laſt reward the Good, and puniſh the Wicked. For, <hi>Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do Right?</hi> Is it to be ſuppos'd that the Wiſe and Good God would create Men only to abuſe themſelves and one another? To live a while in Sin and Folly here, and ſome of them in the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant and brutal Wickedneſs, and then go down to the Grave, and ſo there ſhould be an end of them for ever? What is there worthy of the infinite Wiſdom of God, in ſo poor a Deſign as this! Doth not the Voice of Nature it ſelf teach us, and has it not been the general Belief and Expectation of all Ages and Nations, that the proſperous Sinner, who is ſubtle and powerful to do Miſchief, muſt ſuffer in another World, for what he has done amiſs here? And, that all is not to paſs away with us in Sport and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance, in Laughter and Noiſe, in Riot, or in Violence and Cruelty, as ſome Men are willing to believe; as if the World were made for the Wicked, and they to abuſe it.</p>

                        <p>It appears likewiſe, from the common Belief and Experience of Mankind, that as there is a God of infinite Goodneſs and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; ſo there are wicked and malicious Spirits, which are ever contriving the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and Ruine of Men. For beſides the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this from Scripture, which we muſt be allow'd here to alledge in the Nature at leaſt of an Hiſtory, it is Folly to imagine that all the Oracles and Prodigies of the Heathens could be meer Forgeries, and that there was no Ground nor Foundation for ſuch a Belief as univerſally obtain'd in all Nations and Ages of the World, and for the Cuſtoms and Practices, which follow'd upon this Belief, that there are <hi>Daemons,</hi> or Spirits, of an evil and malicious Diſpoſition and Power. I ſhall inſtance only in the unnatural Cruelties which the Heathen World, even the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves, were continually put upon, by the Inſtigation of theſe malicious and wicked Spirits. For the Heathen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions offer'd up Multitudes of innocent Men and Women, and even their own Children, in Sacrifice to their falſe Gods; which is as ſure an Evidence that there are ſuch Beings which requir'd theſe Cruelties from them, as it is, that there are Tyrants and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, when they cauſe innocent Men to be murther'd, and Children to be torn from the Arms of their Parents, and ſlain in their ſight. And though the Dominion of Satan
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61773:34"/>be now reſtrained by the over-ruling Power of the Goſpel, we have as great Evidence from all Hiſtory that there are ſuch Beings as Devils, as we have for any other Matter of Fact whatſoever. There have been, indeed, many falſe Stories concerning Spirits, as well as in other Matters of Hiſtory; but doth this prove that there are none True? Or could the Hiſtorians of all Times and Places be perpetually impoſed upon, or conſpire to impoſe upon others? There is no ancient Hiſtory but gives ſome Inſtance or other of theſe things; and all the Modern Hiſtories of Heathen Nations are full of ſuch Relations as confirm this Truth to us; and even among Chriſtians, thoſe who have by unlawful Arts put themſelves under the Power of wicked Spirits, have been convinced that there are ſuch Beings; which is proved not only by the publick Confeſſions of Witches in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but by <hi>the private

And if the Devil, after ſo much Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Blood as he has caus'd to be ſpilt in his Sacrifices, and after ſo many Oracles and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures, can yet perſwade ſame Men that there is no ſuch Being; this is one of his ſubtileſt Stratagems of all, and proves how great Power, though in a different kind and manner, he ſtill retains over the Minds of Men.</p>
                        <p>Since therefore it is moſt certain, That there is a Being of inſinite Power and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Juſtice and Goodneſs; and that there is likewiſe a malicious cruel Spirit, ever watchful and induſtrious to abuſe and deſtroy Mankind: It is highly reaſonable to believe, that a Being of ſuch infinite Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, after he had created Man, would communicate himſelf to him, would ſet him a Rule by which he ought to live, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe him Laws whereby he might anſwer the Ends of his Creation, and attain to that Happineſs, which he was made capable of, and deſign'd for by his Maker. We cannot ſuppoſe that the God of all Goodneſs and Wiſdom would create Man, and then leave him to himſelf, to follow his own Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to live at random, without any Law or Direction to frame his Actions by, and to be expos'd to all the Aſſaults of an
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61773:35"/>implacable ſubtile Enemy, without any Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Inſtruction given him, or any Help and Aſſiſtance afforded for his Defence. Man, in his Innocence, was not thus to be left to himſelf. And we have all the reaſon in the World to believe, though we had not the expreſs Word of Scripture for it, that the God of infinite Goodneſs would not diſregard this corrupt State of Mankind, but would uſe ſome Means to reclaim them from the <hi>Error of their Ways,</hi> to bring them to a Knowledge of themſelves, and of the Divine Majeſty, to inform them of their Duty, and direct them to Happineſs.</p>
                        <p>How Man became ſo prone to all Evil, we can know only by Revelation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe who reject all Revelation, muſt ſuppoſe that Man was firſt created in this State of Sin and Miſery; which is a very heinous Imputation upon the Goodneſs and Juſtice of God; but to ſuppoſe him plac'd in this Condition, without all help or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, is to charge God ſtill more fooliſhly. But how Men became ſo, is not here the Matter of Enquiry; it is evident that Man is of himſelf in a miſerable and helpleſs Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and conſidering the great Ignorance and Wickedneſs which have been from the Fall of our Firſt Parents viſible continually in the Word, and ſtill reign in it; conſidering, I ſay, the notorious Wickedneſs and groſs Ignorance of Men, which, from the earlieſt

Can we believe it conſiſtent with Infinite Truth, never to manifeſt it ſelf in the World, but to ſuffer all ſorts of Men, of all Nations, to be expoſed to all the Deſigns and Deluſions of Impoſtors, and of ſeducing and Apoſtate Spirits, without any ſufficient Means afforded them to undeceive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue themſelves?

Can we imagine that the True God would behold all this, for ſo many Ages, among ſo many People, and yet not concern himſelf to put a ſtop to ſo much Wickedneſs, and to vindicate his own Honour, and reſtore the Senſe and Practice of Vertue upon Earth?</p>
                        <p>I ſhall, in due place, prove at large, That Mankind have in all Ages had the greateſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61773:37"/>neceſſity for a Revelation to direct and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them; and, That the Philoſophers themſelves taught abominably wicked Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, who yet were the beſt Teachers and Inſtructors of the Heathen World. And we have no true Notion of God, if we do not believe him to be a God of Infinite Power, and Knowledge, and Holineſs, and Mercy and Truth; and yet we may as well believe there is no God at all, as imagine that the God of Infinite Knowledge ſhould take no notice of what is done here below; that Infinite Power ſhould ſuffer it ſelf to be affronted and deſpiſed, without requiring any Satisfaction; that Infinite Holineſs ſhould behold the whole World lie in Wickedneſs, and find out no way to remedy it; and that Superſtition and Idolatry, and all the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Sin and Satan, for ſo long a time, ſhould enſlave and torment the Bodies and Souls of Men, and there ſhould be no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in Infinite Mercy, nor any Care over an erroneous and deluded World, in the God of Truth.</p>

How unreaſonable is it to entertain ſuch a Thought of Almighty God, infinite in Goodneſs and Mercy, as to ſuſpect that he would ſuffer Mankind to make themſelves as miſerable as they can, both in this World and the next, without putting a Stop to ſo fatal a Courſe of Sin and Miſery, or interpoſing any thing for their Direction, to ſhew them the Way to eſcape Deſtruction, and to obtain Happineſs! The Fall of our Firſt Parents is known to us only by Revelation, and therefore is not to be taken into Conſideration, when we argue upon the meer Principles of Reaſon.

                        <p>The great Argument of the Scoffers of the laſt Days, St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, would be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61773:40"/>this, That all things go on in their conſtant Courſe, and that God doth not meddle or concern himſelf with them. <hi>Where is the Promiſe of his Coming? For ſince the Fathers fell aſleep, all things continue as they were from the Creation?</hi> 2 Pet. iii. 4. And if no Promiſe had ever been made, they would have had ſome Reaſon in their Arguing. For that which rendred the Heathen without Excuſe, was, That they did not make uſe of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Knowledge that they had of God, to lead them to the Knowledge of his Revealed Will, which they had frequent Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of becoming acquainted withal, and had many Memorials of it amongſt them in every Nation; but, <hi>they did not like to retain God in their Knowledge.</hi> And this is the Force of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Argument, <hi>Act.</hi> xvii. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> i. (unleſs this latter Chapter were to be underſtood, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> interprets it, of the <hi>Gnoſtick</hi> Hereticks,) That the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ought not to pervert and ſtifle thoſe Natural Notions which God had implanted in their Minds, but from the Law of Nature to proceed to find out the Written Law; and for this Reaſon, the Bounds of the Habitation of other Nations were determin'd and appointed by God, <hi>according to the Number of the Children of Iſrael,</hi> that <hi>they might ſeek the Lord,</hi> and might be able to find and diſcover the True Religion and Way of Worſhip among that People to whom he had reveal'd himſelf,

                           <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxii. 8. <hi>Act.</hi> xvii. 26, 27. They might have been leſs vicious than they were, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Knowledge of a Revelation; and therein they were inexcuſable, that though they could not free themſelves from the Power of Sin, yet they might not have given themſelves ſo wholly up to it, as to become excluded from the Grace and Salvation to be obtained by the Revealed Will of God. And when God has revealed himſelf, all who will not uſe the Means, and by a due Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of their Reaſon endeavour from Natural Religion to arrive at Revealed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inexcuſable for their Negligence and Contempt of God, and the Abuſe of thoſe Talents and Endowments which God has beſtowed upon them. For when God has once given Men warning, and directed them in the way of Salvation, and they will not regard it, they muſt be wilfully ignorant if they will not conſider, that <hi>one day is with the Lord as a thouſand years, and a thouſand years as one day;</hi> and it is Argument of his Patience and Long-ſuffering, that he doth not bring ſpeedy Vengeance upon a diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and rebellious World: <hi>The Lord is not ſlack concerning his promiſe (as ſome men count ſlackneſs,) but is long-ſuffering to us ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night.</hi> Now this is very well conſiſtent and exceedingly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61773:41"/>with all the Divine Perfections, that he ſhould give Men Warning of the Evil and Danger of Sin, and afterwards leave them to their own Choice, whether they will be Righteous and Happy, or Wicked and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable; and then that he ſhould not take the firſt Opportunity to puniſh them, nor lay hold of any Advantage againſt them, but give them time for ſecond Thoughts, and ſpace for Conſideration and Repentance; but if they abuſe ſo much Patience and Loving-kindneſs, that he ſhould at laſt come upon them, when they leaſt think of him, with a mighty and terrible Judgment, and with a ſudden and unexpected Fury. But to ſtand by and look on unconcern'd, and then to take Men upon ſuch a Surprize, without giving them any notice of it before-hand, is a thing impoſſible to be accounted for, and can never be reconcil'd with the Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.

                           </note> inſiſts at large upon this Argument, and carries it ſo far as to prove the Neceſſity of the Incarnation of the Son of God from it: He urges, That it would have been unworthy of the Goodneſs of God to ſuffer all Mankind to be deſtroy'd by the Fraud and Malice of the Devil, or by their own Fault and Negligence; and that it had been more conſiſtent with his Wiſdom and Goodneſs, never to have created Men, than to have ſuffer'd them thus to periſh: <q rend="margQuotes">An Earthly King (ſays he) when he has
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61773:42"/>planted a Colony, will not careleſsly ſuffer his Subjects to become Slaves to a Stranger, or to revolt from him; but he will, by his Proclamations, admoniſh them of their Duty, and oftentimes will ſend Meſſages to them by his Friends; and if there be a Neceſſity for it, will go to them himſelf, to awe them by his Preſence, and recall them to their Obedience. And <hi>(as he there adds)</hi> ſhall not God much rather be ſo mindful of his Creatures, as to uſe ſome Means to reclaim them from their evil Ways, and regain them to his Service? Eſpecially, when they muſt be utterly undone for ever, unleſs he take care of them.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is plain then, that though we had never heard of ſuch a thing as a Miracle, or a Prophecy, or of reveal'd Relgion; yet from the Conſideration of the State of the World, and the great Ignorance and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Humane Nature, it would be reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to expect that God ſhould ſome way make known his Will to Mankind; and we cannot reconcile it to his Attributes, nor conceive how it ſhould be conſiſtent with them, for him to be an unconcerned Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator of ſo much Folly and Wickedneſs, without taking any care to remedy it, God cannot be oblig'd to force Men to obey his Commandments, and comply with his Will, but rather to leave it at their own Choice,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61773:42"/>whether they will be Happy or Miſerable: but it was neceſſary to propoſe the Terms of Salvation to them, to offer them their free Choice, to ſet before them Life and Death, Bleſſings and Curſings, and ſo to leave the Obſtinate without all Excuſe.</p>
                        <p>And this is all which I am here concern'd to prove, That it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe that God would reveal himſelf to Mankind, and that it is not conceivable how it ſhould be conſiſtent with the Divine Attributes for him not to do it. To own the Being of a God, and yet to deny a Providence, is ſo great an Abſurdity, that none of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, but <hi>Epicurus,</hi> were guilty of it; and this was look'd upon, in him, as amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Denial of the Divine Exiſtence. And to grant both the Being and the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, and yet to confine the Divine Care and Providence to the Bodies only, and Outward Condition of Men, and to imagine that the Spiritual and Immortal Part of Man is diſregarded or neglected by him, is no leſs an Abſurdity than wholly to deny his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence or his Exiſtence; becauſe this is to deny the moſt conſiderable and ineſtimable Part of Providence, which concerns our Souls, and our Eternal State; and therefore it is, by Conſequence, to deny the Attributes of God, and to repreſent him not as he is in himſelf, but Unwiſe, Unmerciful, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy. To ſay that there is no ſuch thing as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61773:43"/>a Divine Revelation, is no better, in Effect, than Atheiſm: For whoever can be of this Opinion, muſt believe only the Being of ſuch Gods as <hi>Epicurus</hi> own'd, that never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd themſelves with Humane Affairs; which was only, in other Words, to ſay that they were no Gods at all.</p>
                        <p>It has therefore been the conſtant Belief and Opinion of all Nations, that their Gods did in ſome way or other Reveal themſelves to Men; and though ſo great a Part of the World have worſhipp'd Falſe Gods, and have been miſtaken as to the particular Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which they receiv'd for Divine, yet it muſt proceed either from Ancient Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or from the Reaſonableneſs of the thing it ſelf, or from both, that the World ſhould expect that the Divine Being ſhould by ſome Means communicate himſelf to Men, and declare his Will to them.</p>

Mankind had neither the Will nor Ability to reform themſelves, and had by their own Fault brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under an utter Incapacity of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd but by ſome extraordinary Revelation. Natural Reaſon might have taught them to be leſs Wicked, but nothing could make them Righteous but a Revelation; and the groſs Errors and Crimes which the wiſeſt Men had fall'n into, ſhews the Neceſſity of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Revelation from God, to inſtruct and inform the World. And the Ways of extraordinary Revelation are but theſe two, either God's immediate Revelation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to particular Perſons; or a Power of working Miracles, and of Propheſying and Foretelling future Events, beſtow'd upon ſome, to convince others that they are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd, and come with a Commiſſion from God, to inſtruct them in what he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd.</p>
                        <p>But it cannot ſeem requiſite, that God ſhould immediately Inſpire or make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelation to every particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the World: For either he muſt ſo powerfully influence their Minds and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as to take away their Choice and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61773:45"/>of Acting, which would be to offer Violence to Humane Nature; or elſe Men would, for the moſt part, have gone on in their wicked Courſes ſtill, and would have deny'd God in their Lives, though their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings were never ſo clearly and fully convinc'd of his Will and Commandments, as well as of his <hi>Eternal Power and God-head.</hi> For, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies, the Heathen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were not ignorant of the Being of God; but <hi>when they knew God, they glorify'd him not as God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> No Man can be more certain of any Inſpiration which he can receive, than he is of the Being of that God, from whom he receives it; and therefore he who denies the Being of God, muſt, by Conſequence, deny the Truth of any ſuch Inſpiration, unleſs it have that powerful Impulſe upon his Mind, as both to convince him, and force him to an Acknowledgement at once of the Being of God, and of the Operation of his Spirit upon his Soul. And it is hard to conceive how any Inſpiration which doth not over-rule the Will and Affections, as well as convince the Underſtanding, ſhould be of more Efficacy upon the Minds and Lives of ſuch Men, than the Notion of a God is. For if Men can ſo ſtifle the Notion of a God in their Minds, as to doubt whether there be any God or no, or at leaſt to act as if there were none; no Reaſon can be given why they might not as well act againſt any Conviction which they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61773:46"/>might receive by Inſpiration, or any other way of immediate Revelation, (unleſs it had an irreſiſtible Effect upon them,) and either take it all for Fancy and Deluſion, or elſe ſo harden themſelves againſt it, as not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd by it: And of this we have <hi>Balaam</hi> for an Example, who, notwithſtanding the Revelations he receiv'd from God, <hi>loved the Wages of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. ii. 15.</p>
                        <p>But, above all Men, the Prophane and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Unbelievers can have leaſt Reaſon to expect that God ſhould vouchſafe them an immediate Revelation.

                           <hi>the Word of the Lord</hi> is ſaid to <hi>try him,</hi> or to purge, to clear and juſtifie him; it being evident, that God would not in that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Inſpire one who had been guilty of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61773:46"/>Crimes which <hi>Joſeph</hi> was accus'd of. It is not to be imagin'd that God ſhould further reveal himſelf to all ſuch in particular, by an immediate Inſpiration, who have rejected all the Manifeſtations which he has made of himſelf, in the Creation and Government of the World; but, that he would reſerve theſe immediate Revelations, as peculiar Favours, to his faithful and obedient Servants. God has ſometimes, indeed, made uſe of wicked Men, <hi>Baalam, Caiaphas,</hi> &amp;c. as his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both in Prophecies and Miracles, to ſhew that they are at his Diſpoſal, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from his Bounty, not from any Worth or Merit of Men; and that he can over-rule the Deſigns and Intentions of the worſt of Men, and make them ſerviceable to him, even againſt their Will, whenever he pleaſeth: But then theſe are peculiar Caſes, in which theſe Gifts were afforded for particular Ends, and for the Benefit of others, and the Men themſelves were never the better for them. But as for the Diſobedient, St. <hi>Paul</hi> acquaints us how, in the general Diſpenſations of his Providence, God dealt with them; <hi>God gave them over to a reprobate Mind,</hi> Rom. i. 28. and he there ſets down a Catalogue of thoſe Sins which were the Conſequence of this Reprobation. The Apoſtle all along maintains, that they had ſo much Knowledge of God, as to render them without Excuſe; and that they would make no Improvement of it, to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61773:47"/>the attaining the Knowledge of the Laws of Nature firſt, and then of his Revealed Will; and it was the juſt Judgment of God to <hi>give them up to their own hearts luſts,</hi> to abandon them to the Tyranny of their Sins, ſince they would take no notice of his Works, and would not <hi>abide his Counſels;</hi> and it muſt needs have been highly inconſiſtent, to ſend immediate Revelations, or afford particular Inſpiration to all ſuch Men as are there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd. <hi>God's Spirit will not always ſtrive with man;</hi> but he withdraws his ordinary Grace from thoſe that abuſe it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can never be preſum'd he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer higher Favours upon them.</p>
                        <p>If Men will believe upon reaſonable Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, they have ſufficient Means of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion allow'd them; but if they will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve without ſome immediate Revelation, they are never like to have that in this World, but in the next God will Reveal himſelf with Terror and Vengeance upon all the <hi>workers of iniquity.</hi> God doth, both by Nature and by Revelation, provide for the Neceſſities, for the Welfare and Happineſs, but never for the Humours and Peeviſhneſs of Men; and thoſe who will not be ſav'd, but according to ſome new Way and Method of their own Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt be miſerable without Remedy. I doubt not, but the greateſt Infidels would own, that if Chriſt ſhould perſonally ſpeak to them in a Voice from Heaven, or appear
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61773:47"/>to them upon Earth, and grant them that Conviction which he once granted to St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> or St. <hi>Paul,</hi> they would believe in him, as theſe Apoſtles did. But they would do well to conſider what Reaſon there can be, why ſo much Favour ſhould be ſhewn to thoſe who reject with Scorn and Deriſion all the Tenders of Grace, and Means of Salvation; and what Obligation God can be under, to ſave them in ſuch a Manner as themſelves ſhall preſcribe, who will not be ſav'd in his Way, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Terms of the Goſpel. And if God ſhould vouchſafe to make ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelation of himſelf to theſe inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Offenders, and Blaſphemers of his Name and Authority; how can we be aſſur'd that they would be converted? Would they not rather find out ſome Pretence to perſwade themſelves that it was no real Revelation, but the Effect of natural Agents, or of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and of a diſturb'd Imagination? For thoſe who have ſo long not only rejected (that were a modeſt thing) but derided and revil'd <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, nay, the Apoſtles, and our Saviour himſelf, <hi>would not believe, though one ſhould riſe from the dead.</hi> They might be terrify'd, perhaps, for the preſent, but they would ſoon ſtifle thoſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions with their accuſtomed Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Atheiſm and Infidelity. I hope to prove, in this Diſcourſe, That all but Atheiſts muſt he convinc'd of the Truth of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61773:48"/>deliver'd down to us in the Old and New Teſtament, if they will but take the pains to conſider them: And Atheiſts could never be convinc'd of any Revelation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; for Men muſt firſt believe that there is a God, before they can believe that he reveals himſelf either to themſelves or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                        <p>But beſides their being ineffectual, and never to be expected by ſuch as this Conceit muſt be calculated for; this Suppoſition, of immediate Revelations to every Man in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, would fill the World with continual Impoſtures and Deluſions. For if every one had a Revelation made to himſelf, every one might pretend to others what he pleas'd; and we know, from the Example of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet who was ſent to propheſie againſt the Altar at <hi>Bethel,</hi> that a Man may be deluded by the Pretence of a Revelation made to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, againſt an expreſs Revelation made to himſelf; and we may conclude that this would often happen, from what we every day experience: For if Men can be perverted by the Arts and Inſinuations of others, againſt their own Reaſon and Judgment, they might as well be prevail'd upon to act againſt a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation made to them, though Revelations were as common and familiar a thing amongſt Men, as Reaſon it ſelf is.</p>
                        <p>So that immediate Revelations to every particular Man would have been needleſs and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61773:48"/>ſuperfluous; they would have been unſuitable to the Majeſty and Honour of God; and they would have been ineffectual to the Ends for which they muſt be ſuppos'd to be deſign'd, and would have given many more Pretences to Impoſtures than there are now in the World.</p>
                        <p>But there were many Conſiderations, even in a wicked World, to move the Compaſſions of Infinite Mercy towards Mankind: Though all were under the Dominion of Sin, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of themſelves to become righteous, yet ſome were more wicked than others; great Numbers of Men were carry'd away to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit heinous Impieties, through their own Ignorance, and the Example of others; and though the Heathen were never without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, yet they were chiefly inexcuſable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God had always a Revealed Will, which he would by ſome Means or other have brought them to the Knowledge of, if they had liv'd according to their Natural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, and of their Duty towards him; and though the Heathen had many Opportunities of becoming acquainted with the Revealed Will of God, yet much Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance was to be made for the Times of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance before the Goſpel. God was pleas'd to reveal himſelf from time to time; and at laſt by the Goſpel, in a more wonderful and evident Manner than ever he had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and to afford Men fuller Means of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61773:49"/>and greater meaſures of Grace to comply with it, and <hi>work out their own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> And God has made theſe Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Will, by enduing certain Men with a Power of Propheſying, and working Miracles, who were to declare his Will to others, and to certifie the reſt of the World that it was indeed his Will and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they deliver'd.</p>
                        <p>And this was the moſt proper Method, and moſt worthy of God. For, as I have prov'd, God would not create Mankind, and then take no further Care of them; ſince, in the State of Innocence, they better deſerv'd his Care, and have ever after ſtood in ſo much need of it, and could at no time be happy, either in this World or the next, without it: And it cannot with any Reaſon be objected, by thoſe who have never ſo great a Mind to cavil at the Terms and Means of Salvation by the Goſpel, That God ſhould apply himſelf to every Perſon by a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Revelation; both becauſe ſo much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion and Indulgence would be ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd upon thoſe who have ſo little deſerv'd it; and becauſe it would have no better Effect than Prophecies and Miracles have had towards the Converſion of Men; but a very ill one, in affording Pretences to all ſorts of Impoſtures: And where two ſeveral Means are alike ſuitable to any End, no Man, ſurely, will preſume to preſcribe to Almighty
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61773:49"/>God, and ſay, that he ought to have us'd one rather than the other; much leſs when one is inconvenient, and the other the only proper Means to be us'd.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. I proceed therefore to ſhew, That Prophecies and Miracles are the moſt ſitting and proper Means for God to diſcover and reveal himſelf to the World by. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that they are not accompany'd with thoſe Inconveniences with which immediate Revelations would have been; there is no Prophecy, nor Miracle, but it has the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd Effect upon many Perſons; the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Honour of God is not expos'd to the Scorn of every prophane and obſtinate Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender; and there is as effectual Care taken to prevent Impoſtures, as poſſibly could have been. And as Prophecies and Miracles have none of the Inconveniences which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Revelations would have had; ſo I ſhall ſhew, that they have all the Advantage and Uſefulneſs which it can be ſuppos'd that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelations would have had, if they had been granted to every Perſon in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. All that any immediate Revelation could do, is to afford Men the Means of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and Aſſurance that the Revelation proceeds from God, as certainly as that God himſelf is: And this Prophecies and Miracles do.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Concerning <hi>Prophecies,</hi> it is obſervable, That the Oracles and Lying Divinations
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61773:50"/>with which the Devil has impos'd upon the World, ſhew, That it is natural for Men to expect that God ſhould reveal himſelf by Prophecies: Which made them ſo prone to receive falſe Prophecies from their falſe Gods. And this may teach us, that true Prophecies are to be expected from the True God. Many Prophecies are of that Nature, that none but God Omniſcient could be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of them; and theſe, in their Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, muſt carry an indiſputable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Divine Revelation along with them. Such are the Predictions of Things to be fulfilled many Ages afterwards, which, in the fulfilling, depend upon the Counſels and Determinations of free Agents; and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of the Sins of Men, which they could not be determin'd to, but by their own Choice. It is above the Capacity of Humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to conceive how it is poſſible that Things ſhould be foreſeen ſo long before either the Actions or the Agents themſelves have any Exiſtence, or how Contingencies can be the Object of Infallible Preſcience: And therefore for God to foretell Things of this Nature by his Prophets, is a moſt proper and certain Way of Revelation; becauſe it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Power of any finite Being to do the like. It is the Prerogative of him that <hi>formeth the Mountains, and createth the Wind, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto Man what is his Thought: The Lord, the God of Hoſts is his Name,</hi> Amos iv. 13.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61773:50"/>For which Reaſon the Falſe Gods are chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd to foretell theſe Things, <hi>Shew the Things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are Gods,</hi> Iſai. xlii. 23.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe Things foretold may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times come to paſs by Chance, or it may be in the Power of Evil Spirits to foretell them when they are in Deſign and Agitation, and juſt ready for Action; or to diſcern Things done at diſtant Places, and to make probable Gueſſes, which may prove true, from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Circumſtances of Affairs which they obſerve in the World: We may therefore be aſſur'd, from the Conſideration of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Attributes of Goodneſs and Truth, that God will not ſuffer falſe Religions to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon the World, under his own Name, by Diabolical Predictions, without affording Means to diſcover them to be ſuch. <hi>When a Prophet ſpeaketh in the Name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to paſs, that is the thing which the Lord hath not ſpoken, but the Prophet hath ſpoken it preſumptuouſly, thou ſhalt not be afraid of him,</hi> Deut. xviii. 22. This is the Mark of Diſtinction between a Falſe and a True Prophet, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the latter foretold in the Name of the Lord, ſhould come to paſs; but whatever the firſt foretold in his Name, ſhould not come to paſs; which implies, that God will diſappoint ſuch Predictions, and not ſuffer them to come to paſs; otherwiſe the coming

But if the Prophecy were not pretended to be in the Name of the True God, but were given out with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd Deſign to entice Men to the Worſhip of Falſe Gods; then God might ſuffer it to be fulfill'd, to prove his People, <hi>Deut.</hi> xiii. 1, 2, 3. For this was conſiſtent with God's Truth and Goodneſs, eſpecially after Warning given, and after ſo clear a Revelation both by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies and Miracles: If any Man, in this Caſe would be ſeduc'd by any Wonder, or Prophecy, to follow other Gods, it muſt be great Perverſeneſs in him. But when Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies are deliver'd by many Prophets, in divers Ages, and different Places, all teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Doctrine, and tending to the ſame End and Deſign in their ſeveral Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that End is the Diſcouragement of all Wickedneſs, and the Maintenance of all Vertue and true Religion, theſe Prophecies have all that can be requiſite to aſſure us that they are from God; and God, by ſuffering them to paſs ſo long in the World, under his own Name, and with all the Characters of his Authority upon them, has given us all poſſible Aſſurance that they are his, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61773:52"/>us, in Honour to his Divine Attributes, to believe that they really are by his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                        <p>And the Certainty of Prophecies being thus grounded upon the Divine Attributes, beſides the direct Evidence which they afford to whatever is deliver'd by them, they add an undeniable Confirmation to thoſe Miracles which have been foretold, and are wrought at the Time, and in the Manner, and by the Perſons foretold by the Prophets; and the Prophecies likewiſe receive as great a Confirmation from ſuch Miracles. For <hi>Prophecies</hi> and <hi>Miracles,</hi> which are ſingly a ſufficient Evidence of Divine Revelation, do mutually ſupport and confirm each other; and hereby we have all the Aſſurance that can be expected of any Divine Revelation: And therefore, as <hi>Prophecy</hi> is in it ſelf a moſt fitting and proper way of Revelation; ſo, in Conjunction with <hi>Miracles,</hi> it is the moſt certain way that can be deſir'd.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Suitableneſs and Efficacy of <hi>Miracles,</hi> to prove a Divine Revelation. It is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant thing to conceive, that God ſhould exclude himſelf from the Works of his own Creation; or, that he ſhould eſtabliſh them upon ſuch inviolable Laws, as not to alter them upon ſome Occaſions, when he foreſaw it would be requiſite to do it: For unleſs the Courſe of Nature had been thus alterable it would have been defective in regard to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61773:53"/>one great End for which it was deſign'd; <hi>viz.</hi> it would have fail'd of being ſerviceable to the Deſigns of Providence upon ſuch Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. The ſame Infinite Wiſdom which contriv'd the Laws for the Order and Courſe of Nature, contriv'd them ſo, as to make them alterable, when it would be neceſſary for God, by ſuſpending the Powers, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the Courſe of Nature, to manifeſt his extraordinary Will and Power; and by the ſame Decree by which he at firſt eſtabliſh'd them, he ſubjected them to ſuch Alterations as his Wiſdom foreſaw would be neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>We can as little doubt, but that He who made the World, has the ſole Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over it; and that nothing can be done in it, but by his Direction and Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or at leaſt by his Permiſſion; and that the Frame and Order of Nature which he at firſt appointed, can at no time be alter'd, but for great Ends and Purpoſes. He is not given to change, as Men are, and can never be diſappointed in his Eternal Purpoſes and Deſigns. But when any thing comes to paſs above the Courſe of Nature, and contrary to it, in Confirmation of a Revelation, which, for the Importance and Excellency of the Subject of it, and in all other reſpects, is moſt worthy of God, we may be ſure that this is his doing; and there is ſtill further Evidence of it, if this Revelation were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy'd of before, by Prophets who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61773:53"/>that it ſhould be confirm'd by Miracle. As, when Men Born blind, receiv'd their Sight; when others were cur'd of the moſt deſperate Diſeaſes, by a Touch, or at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; when the Dead were rais'd, and the Devils caſt out; theſe were evident Signs of a Divine Power and Preſence, which gave Teſtimony to the Doctrine deliver'd by thoſe by whom ſuch Miracles were wrought, and the Divine Commiſſion and Authority was produc'd for what they did and taught. For what could be more ſatisfactory and convincing to Men, or more worthy of God, than to force the Devils themſelves to confeſs and proclaim his Coming? To cauſe the moſt inſenſible things in Nature to declare his Power, by giving way, as it were, and ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back in great Confuſion and Diſorder, at his more immediate and particular Preſence, to inform Men that the God of Nature was there? This gave Teſtimony to the Things reveal'd, and challeng'd the Belief of all Men, in a Language more powerful than any Humane Voice, whilſt God ſhew'd forth his Glory, and made known his Will, by exerciſing his Sovereignty over Nature, in making the whole Creation bow, and tremble, and obey. All which was perform'd accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to expreſs Prophecies concerning Chriſt, that there might be a viſible Concurrence both of Prophecies and Miracles in Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of him. And this Diſpenſation of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61773:54"/>was admirably fitted to propagate that Religion which concern'd the Poor as well as the Rich, the Unlearned as well as the Learned. Miracles were ſuitable to the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Goſpel, and to the univerſal Deſign of it: For they are equally adapted to awaken the Attention, and command the Aſſent of Men of all Conditions and Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities; they are obvious to the moſt Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and may ſatisfie the wiſeſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute or ſilence the Cavils of the moſt Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious or Contentious.</p>
                        <p>And this is what all the World ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, That God ſhould Reveal himſelf to Men, by working ſomewhat above the Courſe of Nature. All Mankind have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd that this is the way of Intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Heaven and Earth; and therefore there never was any of the falſe Religions, but it was pretended to have been confirm'd by ſomething miraculous. We may appeal to the Senſe of all Nations for the Authority of Miracles to atteſt the Truth of Religion: For whenever any thing happen'd extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, they always imagin'd ſomething ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural in it; they expected that Miracles ſhould be wrought for the Proof of any thing that had but the Name of Religion; and no falſe Religion could have gain'd Belief and Credit in any Age or Nation, but under the Pretence of them.</p>
                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:61773:54"/>
                        <p>The only Difficulty therefore will be, to know how to diſtinguiſh True Miracles from Falſe; or thoſe which have been wrought for the Confirmation of the True Religion, from ſuch as have been done, or are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have been done, in Behalf of Falſe Religions.</p>
                        <p>But here it muſt be obſerv'd, That it is not neceſſary, in this Controverſie, that we ſhould be able to determine what the Power of Spirits is, or how far it extends, and what Works can proceed only from the immediate Power of God: It is ſufficient that we know, that God precides over all; that Good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits act in conſtant Subjection and Obedience to him; that Evil Spirits act for Evil Ends; that Good Spirits will not impoſe upon Men, and that he will not ſuffer the Evil to do it, under any Pretence of his own Authority, without affording Means to diſcover the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion. And the Queſtion here is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any ſtrange Work whereof God is not alledged to be the Author, but concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as are wrought with a profeſs'd De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to eſtabliſh Religion in his Name. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then that there have been many Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders wrought in the World, which exceed all Humane Power, and which yet we know not to what other Power to aſcribe: This makes no Difficulty in the preſent Caſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe here, not only the Works themſelves, but the Deſign and Tendency of them is to

For Inſtance, Whether the Miracles reported to have been done by <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> were true or falſe, by a Divine or a Diabolical Power, they are of no Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to us; he eſtabliſh'd no new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and pretended to no Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but doubted the Poſſibility of his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: And ſuppoſing them true, and by a Divine Power, the moſt that can be ſaid of them, is, that as God mention'd <hi>Cyrus</hi> by Name to be the Deliverer of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo he might by Miracle ſignalize this Prince who was to deſtroy them. But the Miracles of our Saviour and his Apoſtles were wrought with this declar'd Purpoſe and Deſign, That they were to give Evidence to the Religion which they were ſent from God to introduce, as neceſſary to the Salvation of Mankind.</p>
                        <p>Having premis'd this, I muſt reſume what was before obſerv'd concerning the Means by which falſe Prophecies might be detected. It has been already prov'd, from the <hi>Notion of a God,</hi> that there muſt be ſome <hi>Divine Revelation;</hi> and it has been ſhewn, That <hi>Prophecies</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> are the moſt fit and proper way of <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and that way which Men have ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to receive <hi>Revelations</hi> by. If then there have been Falſe Prophecies and Miracles, they muſt be ſuppos'd to have been either before, or at the ſame time, or after thoſe Prophecies and Miracles, by which the True Religion was deliver'd; if before, or at the ſame time,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61773:56"/>then the ſame Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs which obliges God to reveal his Will to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, muſt oblige him to take care that the Impoſtures of thoſe falſe Prophecies and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles by ſome Means might have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd. But there is great Reaſon to believe that true Revelations ſhould be firſt made to Men, before God would ſuffer them to be tempted with falſe ones; and if the falſe were after the true Revelations, then the true Revelations themſelves are that by which we ought to judge of all others.</p>
                        <p>But to ſpeak more particularly of <hi>Miracles,</hi> which are the preſent Subject. It is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Infinite Truth and Honour, and Goodneſs and Mercy of God, to ſuffer Man to be deluded by falſe Miracles, wrought under a Pretence of his own Authority, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any poſſibility of diſcovering the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture: And therefore if we ſhould ſuppoſe there had paſt any time before the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his Will to Mankind, he could not ſuffer Men, but through their own Fault, to be impos'd upon by ſuch Miracles; but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the falſe and wicked Doctrines which they were brought to promote and eſtabliſh, as Idolatry, Uncleanneſs, Murders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or by ſome other Token of Impoſture, they might have been undeceiv'd; and both in the Old and New Teſtament God has given us Warning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt falſe Miracles, <hi>Deut.</hi> xiii. 1. <hi>Mat.</hi> xxiv. 24. <hi>Gal.</hi> i. 8. ſo that we may be aſſur'd that we
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61773:57"/>are to give no Credit to any Miracle that can be wrought to confirm any other Doctrine than what we find in the Scriptures; and if we can but be certify'd that they were true Miracles which gave Teſtimony and Evidence to them, we need concern our ſelves about no other.</p>
                        <p>And the Miracles by which the Scriptures are confirm'd and authoriz'd muſt be true; becauſe there is no precedent Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they contradict, nor any immoral or falſe Doctrine which they deliver, nor any thing elſe contain'd in them whereby they can be prov'd to be falſe: And in this Caſe, that which all the Wit and Underſtanding of Men cannot prove to be falſe, muſt be true, or elſe God would ſuffer his own Name and Authority to be uſurp'd and abus'd, and Mankind to be impos'd upon in a thing of infinite Conſequence, without any Poſſibility of diſcovering the Impoſture, which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Divine Attributes for him to permit; but either by the Works themſelves, or by the End and Deſign of them, or by ſome Means or other, the Honour and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Mercy of God is concern'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect all ſuch Impoſtures. If Miracles be wrought to introduce the Worſhip of other Gods, beſides him, whom Reaſon, as well as Scripture, aſſures us to be the only True God; if they be done to ſeduce Men to immoral Doctrines and Practices; if they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61773:57"/>be perform'd to contradict the Religion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready confirm'd by Miracles, in which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this Nature could poſſibly be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd; if never ſo aſtoniſhing Miracles be wrought for ſuch ill Deſigns as theſe, they are not to be regarded, but rejected with that Conſtancy which becomes a Man who will act according to the Principles of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon and Religion. But when Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were perform'd, which, both for the End and Deſign of them, as well as for the Manner and Circumſtances of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, had all the Credibility that any Miracle could have, if it were really wrought by God's immediate Power to confirm a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; if theſe Miracles have been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by Prophecies, (as, on the other ſide, the Prophecies were fulfill'd by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,) if they were done publickly before all ſorts of Men, and that often, and by many Men ſucceſſively, for divers Ages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and all agreed in the ſame Doctrine and Deſign; if neither the Miracles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor the Doctrines which are atteſted by them, can be diſcover'd to have any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit or Defect in them, but be moſt excellent and divine, and moſt worthy of God; in ſuch a Caſe we have all the Evidence for the Truth of the Miracles, and of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which they were wrought to eſtabliſh, that we can have for the Being of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For if theſe Miracles and this Religion

But if he both can and will put ſuch a Diſtinction between Falſe Miracles and True, as that Men ſhall not, except it be by their own Fault, be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by falſe Miracles, then that Religion which is confirm'd by Miracles, concerning which nothing can be diſcover'd to be either impious or falſe, muſt be the true Religion. For we have ſeen, that there muſt be ſome Reveal'd Religion, and that this Religion muſt be reveal'd by Miracle; and we have the Goodneſs and Truth and Juſtice of God engag'd, that we ſhould not be impos'd upon by falſe Miracles, without being able to diſcern the Impoſture: And therefore that Religion which both by its Miracles and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Worſhip appears to be Divine, and could not be prov'd to be falſe, if it were ſo, muſt certainly be true; becauſe the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61773:59"/>and Honour of God is concern'd, that Mankind, in a Matter of this Conſequence, ſhould not be deceiv'd, without their own Fault or Neglect, by Impoſtures vented under his own Name and Authority. Upon which account, the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, in aſcribing the Miracles wrought by Chriſt, to <hi>Belzebub,</hi> was ſo heinous above all other Crimes, this being to reject the utmoſt Means that can be us'd for Man's Salvation, and in Effect to deny the Attributes and very Being of God. The Summ of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, That though Miracles are a moſt fit and proper Means to prove the Truth of Religion; yet they are not only to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd alone, but in Conjunction with other Proofs; and that they muſt neceſſarily be true Miracles, or Miracles wrought to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the true Religion, when the Religion upon the account whereof they are wrought cannot be diſcover'd to be falſe, either by any Defect in the Miracles, or by any other Means, but has all the Marks and Characters of Truth. Becauſe God would not ſuffer the Evidence of Miracles, and all other Proofs, to concur to the Confirmation of a falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, beyond all Poſſibility of diſcovering it to be ſo.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. How <hi>Divine Revelations</hi> may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be preſerv'd in the World. It is reaſonable to ſuppoſe that Divine Revelations ſhould be committed to Writing, that they
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61773:60"/>might be preſerv'd for the Benefit of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and deliver'd down to Poſterity, and that a more than ordinary Providence ſhould be concern'd in their Preſervation. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has been ſaid by ſome, of the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Oral Tradition, for the Conveyance of Doctrines, beyond that of Writing, is ſo notoriouſly fanciful and ſtrain'd, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no ſerious Anſwer. For till Men ſhall think it ſafeſt to make Wills, and bequeath and purchaſe Eſtates by Word of Mouth, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than by Inſtruments in Writing, it is in vain to deny that this is the beſt and ſecureſt way of Conveyance that can be taken: So the common Senſe of Mankind declares, and ſo the Experience of the World finds it to be in things which Men take all poſſible Care about; and it is too manifeſt, and much to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that Men are more ſollicitous about things Temporal, than about Eternal; which affords too evident a Confutation of all the Pretences of the Infallibility of Oral Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon this Ground, That the Subject Matter of it are things upon which the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs or Miſery of Mankind depends. <hi>Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come, for ever and ever,</hi> Iſa. xxx. 8.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It is requiſite that a <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> ſhould be of great Antiquity: Becauſe, upon the ſame Grounds that we cannot think that God would not at all Reveal himſelf to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61773:60"/>we cannot ſuppoſe that he would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the World to continue long under a State of Corruption and Ignorance, without taking ſome Care to remedy it, by putting Men into a Capacity of knowing and practiſing the Duties of Vertue and Religion.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Another requiſite of a <hi>Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> is, that it ſhould be fully promulg'd and publiſh'd to the World, for the general Good and Benefit of Mankind, that it may attain the Ends for which a Revelation muſt be deſign'd.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>AS it is evident from the Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, that God would not ſo whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglect Mankind, as to take no Care to diſcover and reveal his Will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments to the World; ſo, when there was ſo great a Neceſſity of Divine Revelation, in order to the Happineſs of Mankind, both in this World and the next, it is not to be believed that he would defer it ſo long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he made known his Will, as till the Date of the firſt Antiquities amongſt the Heathen. It cannot be deny'd, that ſome Books of the Seripture are much the Ancienteſt Books of Religion in the World; for it were in vain to pretend that the Works in this kind (or indeed in any other) of any Heathen Author can be compar'd with the Pentateuch, for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. And the Antiquity of theſe Books is one conſiderable Circumſtance, whereby we may be convinc'd that they are of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation. For if God would not ſuffer the World to continue long in a ſtate of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Wickedneſs without a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we may conclude, that he would not ſuffer the Memory of it to be loſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Book of this Nature, which is ſo much
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61773:62"/>the ancienteſt in the World, being conſtantly received as a Divine Revelation, carries great Evidence with it that it is Authentick. For the firſt Revelation, as hath been proved, is to be the <hi>Criterion</hi> of all that follow; and God would not ſuffer the ancienteſt Book of Religion in the World to paſs all along under the Notion and Title of a <hi>Revelation,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſing ſome Diſcovery to be made of the Impoſture, if there were any in it; much leſs would he preſerve it by a particular and ſignal Providence, for ſo many Ages. It is a great Argument for the Truth of the Scriptures, that they have ſtood the Teſt, and received the Approbation of ſo many Ages, and ſtill retain their Authority, though ſo many ill Men, in all Ages, have made it their endeavour to diſprove them: but it is ſtill a further Evidence in behalf of them, that God has been pleaſed to ſhew ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable a Providence in their preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>The Account we have of Divine Revelation, in the Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> is from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World; for he relates the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which from the Beginning paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, and this might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered down either by Writing or by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, till <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time. For <hi>Methuſelah</hi> living with <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Shem</hi> with <hi>Methuſelah, Iſaac</hi> with <hi>Shem,</hi> and <hi>Amram</hi> the Father of <hi>Moſes</hi> living with the Patriarchs, the Sons of <hi>Jacob,</hi>
                           <pb n="50" facs="tcp:61773:63"/>the Hiſtory of the Creation, and of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations which God had been pleas'd to make of himſelf to their Fore-fathers, could not be unknown to that Age: Such a Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity could not but be zealous to preſerve the Memory of ſo great Honours and Bleſſings; and their living in <hi>Goſhen,</hi> ſeparate from the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> did much contribute to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their Antiquities; for there they liv'd in Expectation of a Deliverance, and of ſeeing the Prophecies fulfill'd that were made to their Fore-fathers concerning it. The famous Prediction made to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> xv. 13. could not be forgotten in ſo few Generations: for the coming out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> was, as it was there foretold it ſhould be, in the Fourth Generation, reckoning from <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the firſt of the promiſed Seed, to <hi>Moſes,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively, <hi>Exod.</hi> vi. 16.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems to referr to ſome things that happened near the Beginning of the World, as well known in his own time, as <hi>Gen.</hi> iv. 22. where he ſays, <hi>the ſiſter of Tubal Cain was Naamah:</hi> For no probable account can be given, why <hi>Naamah</hi> ſhould be mention'd, but becauſe her Name was then well known among the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> for ſome reaſon which it doth not concern us to be acquainted with, but which ſerved to confirm to them the reſt of the Relation. Some have delivered, that <hi>Naamah,</hi> by her Beauty, enticed the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> or the Poſterity of <hi>Seth,</hi> to commit
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61773:63"/>Idolatry, <hi>Gen.</hi> vi. 2. And ſo <hi>Gen.</hi> xi. 29. we read, that <hi>Haran</hi> was the Father of <hi>Iſcha,</hi> as well as of <hi>Milcah;</hi> and <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxvi. 24. <hi>this was that Anah that found the Mules</hi> (or the Hot-Baths, or that fell upon the <hi>Emims,</hi> or Giants, mention'd <hi>Deut.</hi> ii. 10, 11. however the word be underſtood) <hi>in the wilderneſs, as he fed the aſſes of Zibeon his father:</hi> Theſe and ſuch like Particulars, muſt have been preſerved, and commonly known among the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and were therefore inſerted to ſerve as <hi>Epocha's,</hi> and notes of Remembrance, for the better underſtanding the reſt of the Hiſtory. The Story and manner of Life of <hi>Nimrod</hi> was conveyed in a Proverb; <hi>Wherefore it is ſaid, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord,</hi> Gen. x. 9. And the Remembrance of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s offering up his Son, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained both by the Name of the Place, and by a Proverbial Saying; <hi>And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is ſaid to this day, In the mount of the Lord it ſhall be ſeen,</hi> Gen. xxii. 14. And there is no doubt to be made, but that there were other the like Remembrances of the moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tranſactions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Joſephus</hi> has proved, that Authors of all Nations agree, that in ancient Times Men lived to the Age of about a Thouſand Years; and ſome are known to have lived to a very great Age in latter Times. But however, it had been more ſerviceable to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s purpoſe, if
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61773:64"/>he had had any other deſign but Truth, that Men ſhould not have been ſo long lived. For when he had ſo much ſcope for his Invention (if it had been an Invention of his own) he would never have fix'd the Creation of the World at the diſtance of ſo few Generations from the time in which he wrote, but would rather have made the Generations of Men more, and their Lives ſhorter, that ſo he might the better have concealed his Fictions in obſcure and uncertain Relations, which muſt be ſuppoſed to be delivered through ſo many hands down to that Age. The diſtance of Time from the Flood to <hi>Moſes</hi> was more than it is from the Conquſt to the preſent Age, but half of this time <hi>Noah</hi> himſelf was living: and therefore allowing for the greater length of Mens Lives in thoſe Ages than in ours, the time when <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote cannot be computed at ſo great a diſtance from the Flood, as we are at from the Reformation. But is it poſſible to make any Man of tolerable Senſe, amongſt us, believe that <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. was the firſt King of <hi>England?</hi> that he lived above Seven hundred Years ago? that there was a Deluge ſince his time which ſwept all the Inhabitants away of this Iſland, and of the whole World beſides, but ſome ſeven or eight Perſons, and that all whom we now ſee were born of them? And yet this, as ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous as it ſeems, is not more abſurd than <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Account of the Creation and the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61773:64"/>Flood muſt have been to thoſe of his own Time, if it were falſe.</p>
                        <p>For it is very reaſonable to think, as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> informs us, that Writing was in uſe before the Flood: And it is not improbable, as ſome have conjectured, that the Hiſtory of the Creation, and the reſt of the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> was, for the ſubſtance of it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered down to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time in Verſe, which was the moſt eaſie to be remembred, and the moſt ancient of all ſorts of Writing, and was at firſt chiefly uſed for Matters of Hiſtory, and conſiſted of plain Narration, without much of Art or Ornament. We read of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental Muſick, <hi>Gen.</hi> iv. 21. before the Flood; and Vocal Muſick being ſo much more natural than Inſtrumental, it is likely that Poetry was of as great Antiquity, both in their Hymns and Praiſes of God, and as a help to their Memories, which are the two Ends to which <hi>Moſes</hi> applies his own Songs, or Poems, <hi>Exod.</hi> xv. <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxii. If it be thought that there was no Writing before the Flood, becauſe there is no Account of the Invention of it, tho' the Inventors of other infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Arts be mention'd; this rather proves the contrary, and that it was coaeval with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, or was the Invention of <hi>Adam.</hi> It is not probable that in ſo long a Life, he ſhould find out nothing for the uſe of himſelf and his Poſterity, though no Invention be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to him; and Writing is ſo neceſſary,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61773:65"/>that the World could very ill ſubſiſt without it for above Fifteen hundred Years. The <hi>Grecians,</hi> and other Nations, have recorded the firſt Inventors, as they ſuppoſed, of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as thoſe who beſt deſerved a Memorial in Hiſtory; and ſince there is no other men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt the ancienteſt <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers, but that they were before the Flood, ſome of them alſo aſcribing them to <hi>Adam,</hi> this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that they were of the greateſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and the Time of their Invention is no more known than that of Ploughing and Sowing, and other neceſſary Arts, which were from the Beginning of the World.</p>
                        <p>But though it ſhould be ſuppoſed, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Flood, they had not the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies for preſerving the Remembrance of things paſt, that we have had ſince, yet things of this nature could never be impoſed upon the generality of Men; and if they had leſs Means of conveying things paſt to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, they had fewer things to convey; and all their Hiſtories being concerning the Anceſtors of their own Families, they were eaſily remembred; and however ſhort and imperfect, they could not be ſo defective, as that Men ſhould generally be ſo groſsly ignorant as to ſwallow ſuch Impoſtures: They had One Day in Seven purpoſely ſet apart for the Praiſe and Worſhip of God, and the Commemoration of his Mercies vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to Mankind; and they, who had Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61773:65"/>Remembrances of <hi>Nimrod,</hi> the third from <hi>Noah,</hi> could not be ignorant of <hi>Noah</hi> himſelf, and of the Flood in his time.</p>
                        <p>In ſo few Generations of Men as had paſt, by reaſon of the long Lives of the Patriarchs, it was impoſſible for <hi>Moſes</hi> to impoſe upon thoſe of his own Age in things ſo memorable as the Creation of the World, and the Flood, and the Deſtruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> &amp;c. But when, ſo long after the Flood, the Sons of <hi>Noah</hi> were diſperſed into ſo far diſtant places of the Earth, and their Manners and Cuſtoms were different, and their Lives ſhorter, it became neceſſary that a true and laſting Account of thoſe things ſhould ſtand recorded in a Book of infallible Credit and Authority, for the benefit of future Ages, leſt, in proceſs of time, the Remembrance of them ſhould become obſcure and confuſed, and fabulous Stories ſhould be impoſed upon the World for Truth, in Matters of ſo great importance. For it has been obſerved by divers learned Men, that the moſt ancient Hiſtories, as well as the Philoſophy and Theology of the Heathens, contain many things concerning the Creation of the World, the firſt Propagation Mankind, the Flood, and other particulars; which have ſo plain an agreement with what we read in the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that they are ſuppoſed to be taken out of it: but they are obſcured and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed under other Names and Characters,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61773:66"/>to conceal from whence they were originally taken, and to gain them the better accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance amongſt thoſe for whoſe uſe the Books containing them were deſigned by their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. And when the Remembrance of God's Dealings with paſt Ages began to fail, and the ways of Humane Conveyance were ſo uncertain, it was requiſite that ſome infallible Account ſhould be given of Gods Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and his Communications of himſelf in the firſt Ages, which might be tranſmitted down to Poſterity, unto the End of the World.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THE End and Deſign of a Revelation from Heaven, muſt be for the Good of Mankind, and therefore it was neceſſary that it ſhould be known and promulged in the World; and that Revelation which has been known to moſt Nations, and fartheſt divulged, carries another Evidence of its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority. For ſince it is neceſſary there ſhould be ſome Divine Revelation, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neceſſary that it ſhould be ſufficient to the Ends for which it was deſigned; and it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61773:66"/>was revealed, not to be concealed, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a few Perſons, but to rectifie the Miſtakes, and regulate the Manners of Men; and therefore that which has been moſt known, and fartheſt propagated, we have reaſon to think to be a true Revelation. If every thing elſe concurr to prove it true, the very Promulgation of it is a conſiderable Evidence in proof of its Divine Authority: Becauſe it is not to be ſuppoſed that God would either ſuffer his own Revelation to be ſo ſtifled and ſurpreſs'd, as to become of little or no uſe and benefit to the World, or that he would permit falſe Revelations to be more known and divulged; either of which would very ill conſiſt with the Intention of Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Will to Mankind.</p>
                        <p>It has been already proved, That it is not to be expected that God ſhould Reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to every Man in particular; and it could not be requiſite that he ſhould afford a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and ſtanding Revelation in all Nations of the World. For if Mankind be ſufficiently provided for in the Neceſſaries of Salvation, this is all which in Reaſon can be expected from a Juſt and Good God to ſinful and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Man. If Men be put in the Ready Way of Salvation, and have ſufficient Means al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them to attain it; all beyond this is the meer arbitrary effect of Infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and depends wholly upon the good Pleaſure of God, being more than we could
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61773:67"/>promiſe our ſelves from his Juſtice, or, by Reaſon, foreſee from his Mercy it ſelf. And his Wiſdom ſo orders and diſpoſes the Effects and Emanations of his Mercy, as to render them conſiſtent with his Juſtice and Honour, as He is Governor of the World.</p>
                        <p>And if, in the firſt Ages, Revelations were frequent, and generally known amongſt all Mankind, till by their own fault and neglect they were with-holden from them; it was the great Mercy of God, afterwards, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to thoſe Nations, who had deſpiſed and rejected him, an opportunity of knowing his Will revealed to others: And this God was pleaſed to do, by appointing a choſen Seed, and ſelecting to himſelf a peculiar People to bear his Name before the Nations; and, by the various Diſpenſations of his Providence, he ſo diſpoſed of that People, that all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might be inſtructed in the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and delivered to them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt</hi> then, I ſhall ſhew, That in the firſt Ages of the World, the Revealed Will of God was known to all Mankind.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> That in ſucceeding Ages there has ſtill been ſufficient Means and frequent Opportunities for all Nations to come to the Knowledge of it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In the firſt Ages of the World, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will of God was known to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And here we muſt have recourſe to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61773:67"/>the Hiſtory of the Bible; ſince it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all learned Men to be ſo much the ancienteſt Book, which can give us an Account of Religion, in the World. For unleſs we will reject all Hiſtory, and believe nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated of Ancient Times, we muſt take our Accounts from ſuch Books as treat of them: And till, by the Method propoſed, I have proved the Bible to be of Divine Authority, I ſhall alledge it only as an Hiſtorical Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Things paſt; in which reſpect, it would be unreaſonable to deny it that credit which is allowed to other Books of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And this is all that is now deſired, in order to the clearing of what I am at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent upon; which is to ſhew, That nothing requiſite to a true Revelation is wanting to the Scriptures; and therefore, that they have been ſufficiently promulged and made known to the World.</p>
                        <p>In the Beginning of the World, God was pleaſed to create but one Man, and one Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and to People the Earth from them; which muſt exceedingly tend both to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Order and Obedience amongſt Men, and to the retaining of the Knowledge of God, and of his Ways and Dealings with the firſt Parents of Mankind. But if Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes had been created, and the Earth had been peopled at once, the natural effect of this had been Ambition and Strife, Confuſion and Ignorance: For as the Inhabitants of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61773:68"/>World multiplied, ſo did all Sin and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs encreaſe; though all deſcended from the ſame Parents, and theſe Parents lived to ſee many Generations of their Off-ſpring, and to inſtruct and admoniſh them; which, if any thing could have done it, muſt have kept up a ſenſe of God and Religion amongſt Men. <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf performed the Office of a Father, a Prieſt, and a King, to his Children; and the Office and Authority of theſe three deſcended upon the Heads of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, in the ſeveral Generations and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of Kingdoms amongſt his Poſterity: For that the ſame Perſon was both King and Prieſt in the earlier Ages of the World, we learn from the beſt Antiquities of other Nations; and it was ſo likewiſe amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> till God had appointed an Order and Succeſſion of the Prieſthood in one Tribe: and therefore <hi>Eſau</hi> is ſtiled a <hi>profane Perſon,</hi> for ſelling his Birth-right;

                        <p>By all the Accounts we have of the World before the Flood, we are aſſured, that God was pleaſed, at firſt, to afford frequent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of himſelf to Mankind; and even to the Wicked, as to <hi>Cain,</hi> whoſe Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment it afterwards was to be <hi>hid from the face</hi> of the Lord, and driven out from <hi>his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi>

And when the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Men had provoked God to drown the World, he revealed this to <hi>Noah,</hi> and reſpited the execution of this Judgment an Hundred Years; and <hi>Noah,</hi> in the mean time, both by his Preaching, and by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring an Ark, warned them of it, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them to Repentance: by <hi>preparing of an ark to the ſaving of his houſe, he condemned the world,</hi> Heb. xi. 7. and he was <hi>a preacher of righteouſneſs to the old world,</hi> 2 Pet. ii. 5. He made it his buſineſs, for above an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years together, to forewarn the wicked World of their approaching Ruine; which he did by all the Ways and Means that a Wiſe and Great Man could contrive, proper for that End.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Noah</hi> lived, after the Flood, Three hundred and fifty Years, <hi>Gen.</hi> ix. 28. and it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween One and Two hundred Years before the Diviſion of Tongues, and the Diſperſion of the Sons of <hi>Noah.</hi> And when all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Earth were of one Language, and lived not far aſunder, <hi>Noah</hi> himſelf living amongſt them; the Judgment of God upon the wicked World, in overwhelming them with the Flood; his Mercies to <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family, in their preſervation, when all the reſt of the World periſhed; and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments which God gave to <hi>Noah</hi> at his coming out of the Ark, with his Promiſes and Threatnings reſpectively to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61773:69"/>or trangreſſion of them, muſt be well known: and the ſin in building the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> for which the Univerſal Language was confounded, and the Race of Mankind diſperſed, could proceed from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the heigth of Preſumption and Perverſeneſs. After the Confuſion of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and the Diſperſion of Mankind, they could not on the ſudden remove to very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and remote Places, by reaſon of the unpaſſable Woods and Deſarts and Marſhes, which, after ſo vaſt an Inundation, muſt be every where to be met with, to obſtruct their paſſage, in thoſe hot and fruitful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, when they had lain uninhabited for ſo many Years. This we may the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, from the ſlow progreſs which was made in the Diſcoveries of the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> For the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in thoſe places where they found neither Guide nor Path, did not enter the Country ten Miles
<note n="(f)" place="margin">See Sir <hi>W. Rau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh, l.</hi> 1. c. 8. §. 3.</note> in ten Years. And in thoſe Ages they could not but be ill provided, either by their own Skill, or by convenient Tools and Inſtruments, with fit means to clear the Countrey which they were to paſs; and they were likewiſe unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of Veſſels to tranſport any great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Men, with their Families, and Herds of Cattle, which were for many Ages their only Riches, and abſolutely neceſſary for their Suſtenance: for Navigation had never had ſo ſlow an Improvement in the World,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61773:69"/>if it had ſo ſoon been in that Perfection as to enable them for ſuch Tranſportation.</p>
                        <p>And as for theſe Reaſons, the Diſperſion of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Poſterity over the Earth muſt be gradual, and many Generations muſt paſs, before the remoter Parts of it could be inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited; ſo the ſeveral Plantations muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to hold Correſpondence with thoſe to whom they were neareſt allyed, and from whom they went out; they muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to own ſome ſort of Dependance upon them, and pay them ſuch Acknowledgments as Colonies have ever done to their Mother-Cities. It is natural to ſuppoſe that they firſt ſpread themſelves into the neighbouring Countries; and (as Sir <hi>Walter Rauleigh</hi> has obſerved) the firſt Plantations were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by the Banks of Rivers, whereby they might hold Intelligence one with another; which they could not do by Land, that being overſpread with Woods, and altogether unfit for travelling. And the great affinity which is obſervable between the Eaſtern Languages, proves that there was a continual Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Commerce maintained between the ſeveral Nations, after the Diſperſion.</p>
                        <p>All which, conſidering the great Age that Men lived in thoſe times, muſt, without a very groſs Neglect and Contempt of God, preſerve a true Notion of Religion in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts of the World: For <hi>Noah</hi> himſelf lived Three hundred and Fifty Years after
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61773:70"/>the Flood; his Sons were not ſoon diſperſed; their Diſperſion was gradual, and they held a Correſpondence after their Separation, and lived long to educate and train up their Children in that Knowledge of God, which they had received and been inſtructed in themſelves; and beſides, they had little elſe to diſcourſe upon, but ſuch things as would neceſſarily lead them to it: The Hiſtory of their own Nation and Family is that which Men are naturally moſt fond of; and in theſe Ages the Particulars could be but few, and thoſe very remarkable, and almoſt within the memory of ſome yet living; and every <hi>Occurrence</hi> muſt bring to their remembrance what they had heard and had been taught concerning God, and his Dealings with them and their Forefathers.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, there was the ſpecial Hand of God, and a particular Over-ruling Providence, in the Diſperſion and Diviſion of Nations: For, <hi>when the moſt High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he ſeparated the ſons of Adam, he ſet the bounds of the people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of the children of Iſrael,</hi> Deut. xxxii. 8. He <hi>determined the bounds of their habitation, that they ſhould ſeek the Lord, if haply, they might feel after him, and find him,</hi> Act. xvii. 26, 27. This was the reaſon of the Diviſion of the Nations, <hi>according to the number of the children of Iſrael.</hi> There was a particular regard had to the Number
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61773:70"/>of the Choſen Seed, that they might bear a fit proportion to the reſt of Mankind, and might be as ſo much Leaven to the whole Maſs, as a quickning and enlivening Principle to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and maintain due Apprehenſions of God, and his Worſhip and Service in the World: And this is the Reaſon given, why Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy was permitted them; That they who were the peculiar People of God, and were to teach his Commandments to the reſt of the World, might ſufficiently encreaſe and multiply. For though it appears by our Regiſters
<note n="(g)" place="margin">See <hi>Graunt</hi> on the <hi>Bills of Mortality.</hi>
                           </note>, that here more Males are born than Females, to a conſiderable diſproportion, and that therefore Polygamy amongſt us would not tend to the multiplication of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but rather to the contrary; yet in <hi>Judaea</hi> it might be otherwiſe; or the Captive Women, whom they were permitted to marry, might raiſe the number of Females above that of the Males; or their perpetual Wars leſſen'd the number of Males to a degree beneath the Females. However, this is the reaſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by learned Men, why Polygamy, which was not permitted from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſhould be allowed the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> for, indeed, it was of great couſequence that they ſhould multiply ſo as to have a due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the reſt of the World; and for the ſame reaſon, the ſurviving Brother was to raiſe up Seed to the deceaſed. Barrenneſs was a Reproach; and to die Childleſs, a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61773:71"/>Curſe; and a numerous Off-ſpring, a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ſo often promiſed, that it is evident that many Diſpenſations of the Divine Providence depended upon it.</p>
                        <p>And the better to revive and keep up a Senſe of Religion amongſt Men, thoſe who were moſt eminent for Piety were employed to be God's Heralds and Embaſſadors to the reſt of the World, as the whole People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are appealed to as his <hi>Witneſſes, Iſai.</hi> xliii. 12. and xliv. 8.

For <hi>Pharaoh</hi> admiring the Beauty of <hi>Sarah, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Wife, takes her into his Houſe: for
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61773:71"/>which, great Plagues were inflicted on him and his Houſhold; and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> perceiving the reaſon of it, ſends him away, with his Wife, and all that he had. By this it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came notorious to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Princes, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was under God's peculiar Care and Providence, and that therefore it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned them to regard what he profeſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion, and the Worſhip of God. <hi>Abimelech</hi> likewiſe, King of <hi>Gerar,</hi> ſent and took <hi>Sarah:</hi> Upon which God appeared to him in a Dream; and declared to him that <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Prophet, and that he ſhould <hi>pray for him;</hi> and this <hi>Abimelech</hi> told to <hi>all his ſervants,</hi> Gen. 20.7, 8. and he calls upon God, by his Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> ver. 4. which ſhews that he had Knowledge of the True God.</p>
                        <p>After <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> were returned into <hi>Canaan</hi> from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> upon ſome diſagreement between their Herds-men, they parted from each other, <hi>Lot</hi> going towards <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> to the Plain of <hi>Mamre,</hi> in <hi>Hebron.</hi> And it came to paſs, that there was War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Nine Kings of that Countrey, four being Confederate on the one ſide, and five on the other. But the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> and his Confederates being defeated in Battle, <hi>Lot,</hi> who dwelt in <hi>Sodom,</hi> was, with all his Goods, carried away by the Enemy: Of which when <hi>Abraham</hi> was informed, he armed his Servants, and with no more than

                        </p>
                        <p>Afterwards God manifeſted himſelf to the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> by a various and wonderful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: for the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> dwelt in <hi>Aegypt</hi> Four hundred and fifty Years, till at laſt, by Signs and Wonders, and dreadful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; by Judgments upon their <hi>Firſt-born,</hi> and upon <hi>their Gods,</hi> Num. xxxiii. 4. they were brought out from thence; and <hi>the nations heard the fame</hi> of it, and <hi>all the earth was filled with the glory of the Lord,</hi> Num. xiv. 15, 21.</p>
                        <p>Thus <hi>Chaldaea</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the moſt famous and flouriſhing Countreys in thoſe Ages of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61773:76"/>the World, had the true Religion brought home to them by the Patriarchs, who were ſent from place to place to ſojourn, to be a Pattern and Example to the reſt of Mankind. And Men who travell'd ſo far, and converſed with ſo many Nations, and were ſo zealous for God's Honour, and had ſuch frequent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, and the immediate Direction of God himſelf in moſt of the Actions of their Lives, and who were ſo Great and Powerful, and ſo Numerous, muſt needs mightily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate Religion where-ever they came, and leave the Idolaters without excuſe; and it cannot be doubted but that they had great ſucceſs in all places; for even out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where they endured the greateſt hardſhip, and were in ſuch contempt and hatred, yet <hi>a mix'd multitude went up alſo with them,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Native <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Exod. xii. 38.</p>
                        <p>And as <hi>Chaldaea</hi> and <hi>Aegypt</hi> were famous for Learning and Commerce, and proper Places, by their ſituation, from whence the Notions of Religion might be propagated both towards the Eaſt and Weſt, to other Parts of the World; ſo I muſt again obſerve, that God's Mercy was particularly manifeſted towards the <hi>Canaanites</hi> before their Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: The Example of <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> who reigned among them, and the ſojourning of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> not to mention <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> with their nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Famllies, afforded them continual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61773:76"/>and Admonitions for their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Amendment; eſpecially the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and the miraculous Deliverance of <hi>Lot,</hi> was enough to ſtrike an Awe and Terrour into the moſt Obdurate. But when they would not make any due uſe of theſe Mercies, when they perſiſted ſtill in their Impieties, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in them till they had filled up the meaſure of their Iniquities: God made them an Example to others, after they would take no Warning themſelves; yet ſtill <hi>executing his judgments upon them by little and little, he gave them place of repentance, not being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that they were a naughty generation, and that their malice was bred in them, and that their cogitation would never be changed,</hi> Wiſd. xii. 10.</p>
                        <p>How much the true Religion prevailed by theſe Diſpenſations of Providence, among other Nations beſides the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> we have an <hi>illuſtrious</hi> Inſtance in <hi>Job</hi> and his Friends, who were Princes in their ſeveral Dominions; they had knowledge of the Fall of the Angels, <hi>Job</hi> iv. 18. and of the Original Corruption of Man, which is expreſſed with this emphaſis, that he cannot be <hi>clean,</hi> or <hi>righteous,</hi> who <hi>is born of a woman;</hi> becauſe by <hi>Eve</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion Sin came into the World, <hi>Job</hi> xiv. 1. xv. 14. and xxv. 4. <hi>Adam</hi> is mention'd, <hi>chap.</hi> xxxi. 33. the Reſurrection is deſcribed, <hi>chap.</hi> xiv. 12. and it appears that Revelations were vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61773:77"/>to theſe Nations, <hi>chap.</hi> xxxiii. 15. It appears, that the Fundamentals of Religion were known Doctrines amongſt them, and are therefore mention'd both by <hi>Job</hi> himſelf, and by his Friends, in as plain terms as may be, and as fully as can be expected in a Book which is. Poetical, the nature whereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that known things ſhould be alluded to, but not ſo particularly related as in Hiſtory. And there is no doubt but the Propagation of Religion, in other parts of the World, would be as evident, if the Scriptures had not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally only, and in the Courſe of other things, but of ſet purpoſe treated of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; as me may gather from the footſteps to be found in Heathen Authors, of what the Scriptures deliver to us, and from the ſeveral Alluſions and Repreſentations in the Rites and Ceremonies of their Religions, expreſſing, though obſcurely and confuſedly, the chief Points of the Scripture-ſtory, as has been ſhewn by divers learned Men.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In ſucceeding Ages, after the giving the Law, when the <hi>Jews,</hi> by their Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion and Government, may ſeem to have been wholly ſeparated from the reſt of the World, and the Divine Revelations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to one Nation, there ſtill were ſufficient Means and frequent Opportunities for all Nations to come to the Knowledge of the Truth. And here I ſhall ſhew, (1.) That the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> did particularly provide for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61773:77"/>the Inſtruction of other Nations in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion, and that the Scriptures give frequent Commandment and Encouragment concerning it. (2.) That the Providence of God did ſo order and diſpoſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Affairs, as to offer other Nations fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Opportunities of becoming inſtructed in the true Religion, and that multitudes of Proſelytes were made of all Nations.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> did particularly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the Inſtruction of other Nations in the Revealed Religion, and the Scriptures give frequent Commandment and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning it. The <hi>Strangers</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes,</hi> amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> were of two ſorts: for either they were ſuch as became Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and obliged themſelves to the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who were ſtyled <hi>Proſelytes of Righteouſneſs,</hi> or of the Covenant; or they were ſuch as believed in the True God, and profeſſed only to obſerve the Precepts given to <hi>Noah,</hi> which compriſed the Subſtance of the Ten Commandments; and theſe were called <hi>Proſelytes of the Gates,</hi> becauſe they were permitted to live amongſt them, within their Gates; theſe are the <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in their Gates,</hi> mention'd <hi>Deut.</hi> xiv. 21. who might eat of ſuch thing's as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> themſelves were forbidden to eat of.</p>
                        <p>If any would be Circumciſed, and undertake the Obſervation of the whole Law, they had full liberty, and the greateſt encouragement
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61773:78"/>to do it. At the firſt Inſtitution of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, not only <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, but his whole Family, and all that were bought <hi>with money of any Stranger,</hi> were to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. 12, 27. and at the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Paſſover, the Stranger is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to obſerve it, as well as the Natural <hi>Iſraelite, Exod.</hi> xii. 19. God made no diſtinction in the Inſtitution of both theſe Sacraments between the <hi>Jews</hi> and thoſe other Nations that dwelt amongſt them, and were willing to conform themſelves to the Obſervation of the Law; but firſt to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he appointed Circumciſion; and then to <hi>Moſes,</hi> when the Paſſover was inſtituted, particular Order is given concerning <hi>Strangers</hi> or <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> who would betake themſelves to them, <hi>one law ſhall be to him that is home-born, and to the ſtranger that ſojourneth among you,</hi> Exod. xii. 49. <hi>Deut.</hi> xxix. 11. And as the receiving the Seal of Circumciſion was an admiſſion into Covenant with God, and implied an Obligation to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the whole Law, and a Right to the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of it, which was confirmed and renewed by their partaking of the Paſſover: ſo it is to be obſerved, not only that God did in general admit Strangers and Aliens to the ſame Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the <hi>Jews,</hi> but that throughout their whole Law frequent mention is made of them, and care taken for their Reception and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: for though what is but once ſaid in Scripture, is a ſufficient Proof of the Will and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61773:78"/>Pleaſure of God in any matter; yet when a thing is often mention'd, and every where inculcated, it is an Evidence to us, that God would have the more notice taken of it, and has laid the ſtricteſt Obligation upon all to obſerve it. But we find expreſs mention made of the <hi>Stranger</hi> at the appointment of the Yearly Feaſt of Atonement, <hi>Lev.</hi> xvi. 29. The Stranger was obliged to bring his Sacrifice to the Door of the Tabernacle of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and in the Prohibitions of eating Blood, he is particularly forbidden it, <hi>ch.</hi> xvii. 8, 9, 12, 15. All the Laws relating to Marriage, and concerning unlawful Luſt, are equally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd the <hi>Stranger</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelite, ch.</hi> xviii. 26. he was to be ſtoned, if he gave any of his Seed unto <hi>Moloch, chap.</hi> xx. 2. and he was obliged to all the ſame Laws concerning Sacrifices, <hi>chap.</hi> xxii. 18. and was to be ſtoned for Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, <hi>chap.</hi> xxiv. 16. The Sabbath was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the Stranger within their Gates, <hi>Exod.</hi> xx. 10. &amp; xxiii. 12. <hi>Lev.</hi> xxv. 6. <hi>Deut.</hi> v. 14. The Stranger was to hear the Law read in the Solemnity of the Year of Releaſe, <hi>chap.</hi> xxxi. 12. And the Covenant is expreſsly made with the Stranger, <hi>chap.</hi> xxix. 12. <hi>Joſh.</hi> viii. 33, 35.</p>
                        <p>And as the <hi>Strangers</hi> or <hi>Proſelytes</hi> were thus join'd, in the very Deſign and Inſtitution of the Law, with the Native <hi>Iſraelites</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as to all the Acts and Privileges of Religious Worſhip; ſo God had a particular regard to them in their Civil Statutes and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61773:79"/>Ordinances, to free them from Oppreſſion, and every thing that might give Strangers any diſcouragement from living amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and becoming Partakers of their Religion with them: <hi>Thou ſhalt neither vex a ſtranger, nor oppreſs him; for ye were ſtrangers in the land of Aegypt,</hi> Exod. xxii. 21. <hi>Alſo thou ſhalt not oppreſs a ſtranger; for ye know the heart of a ſtranger, ſeeing ye were ſtrangers in the land of Aegypt,</hi> chap. xxiii. 9. It ſeems, one reaſon of their being ſo long detained in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> was to teach them Humanity and Compaſſion to Strangers: <hi>Thou ſhalt not oppreſs an hired ſervant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy ſtrangers that are in thy land within thy gates,</hi> Deut. xxiv. 14. And care is taken of the Stranger, that he be not brought into want, or ſuffered to periſh in his Diſtreſs; for the Gleanings of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt and of the Vintage were his Portion: <hi>Thou ſhalt leave them for the poor and the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: I am the Lord,</hi> Lev. xix. 10. &amp; xxiii. 22. All manner of Kindneſs and Affection is in moſt expreſs and ample terms commanded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all Strangers: <hi>And if a ſtranger ſojourn with thee in your land, ye ſhall not vex him: But the ſtranger that dwelleth with you ſhall be unto you as one born amongſt you, and thou ſhalt love him as thy ſelf; for ye were ſtrangers in the land of Aegypt: I am the Lord your God,</hi> Lev. xix. 33, 34. And <hi>Moſes,</hi> repeating the peculiar Favours which God had beſtowed
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61773:79"/>upon the <hi>Children of Iſrael,</hi> put them in mind, that God <hi>loveth the ſtranger, in giving him food and rayment.

The <hi>Proſelytes</hi> were not excluded from their Sacrifices, their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Sacraments; and if they refuſed to take upon them the Obſervation of the whole Law, yet they had free leave and great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to live amongſt them, believing only in the True God, and obeying thoſe Precepts which were given to all the Race of Mankind after the Flood: They might ſhare in all the Rights of their Religious Worſhip, and were invited to do it, but if they would not ſubmit to this, yet they were not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rejected, but might partake of their Civil Privileges, and live under the protection of their Government: And it is obſervable, that where the ſame Laws are repeated in ſeveral places of Scripture, the <hi>Stranger</hi> is no where omitted; but what relates to him, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly repeated with the reſt, as a neceſſary and eſſential part of the Law.

But this fraudulent way of getting into a League with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> if it had not been for the Oath, which ſecur'd their Lives to them, had forfeited that Right which otherwiſe they might have had to their Lives, by a Peace fairly obtained; and they loſt all other Advantages of the League, but only the ſecuring their Lives.

What good uſe was made of theſe Methods of the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence doth not appear to us, but in all probability it had a good effect upon very many; as we find it had in one remarkable Inſtance of a little Maid, who being taken Captive, was the occaſion of the Cure of <hi>Naaman</hi>'s Leproſie; and of his Converſion to the Worſhip of the True God, who before was known to him by his Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> v. 11.

                        <p>But our preſent Enquiry is not ſo much what the Effect was, as what Means were afforded of Salvation: For though it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that the True Revealed Religion ſhould be publiſhed to the World; yet it is not neceſſary to prove the Truth of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to ſhew that obſtinate Men have taken notice of it, ſo far as to conſider and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it; becauſe it is not neceſſary that God ſhould force his Laws upon Men, but only that he ſhould diſcover them, and afford Men ſufficient Means to know them, and become the better for them.</p>

The <hi>Jews</hi> were in great Eſteem, and in Places of great Honour and Truſt; and their Religion was <hi>extolled</hi> and recommended by Publick Edicts to all under that vaſt Empire. The Almighty Power of God was manifeſted with <hi>Miracles,</hi> and by the <hi>Interpretation of Dreams</hi> and <hi>Prophecies;</hi> and his Majeſty and Honour was acknowledged and proclaimed in the moſt publick and ſolemn manner, throughout all the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, at the Command of Princes who were Idolaters, and were forced to it by the meer convictions of their own Conſciences, wrought in them by the irreſiſtable Power of God, <hi>Dan.</hi> ii, iii, iv, v, vi.</p>

                           <hi>Daniel</hi> had acquainted <hi>Cyrus</hi> (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays) with the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in which

The Advancement of <hi>Eſther</hi> and <hi>Mordecai</hi> under <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> and of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> under <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> gave the <hi>Jews</hi> great Authority, and great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunites of propagating their Religion <hi>from India even unto Aethiopia, over an hundred and ſeven and twenty provinces;</hi> for this was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Dominions of <hi>Ahaſuerus, Eſth.</hi> i. 1. and the <hi>Jews</hi> were diſperſed <hi>in all the Provinces</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Babylon, chap.</hi> iii. 8.

It has been proved by ſeveral, and is generally agreed by learned Men, that many of the Rites among the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and other Nations were the ſame with thoſe appointed by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or very like them. But ſome would have it, that <hi>Moſes</hi> took theſe Rites from thoſe Nations, without any Proof, or poſſibility of Proof, that I can perceive. For how ſhould it be proved when we have no Writings or Memorials of theſe Nations ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as thoſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> by many Ages? And we read in the Scriptures, that ſeveral Laws were enjoyn'd the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe they were contrary to the Idolatrous Practices of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> but never find the leaſt intimation that any were given them in imitation of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Worſhip: and it is unreaſonable to imagine that they ſhould have Laws appointed in contradiction to the Idolatrous Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and others at the ſame time in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with them, when they were by a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61773:103"/>Providence ſeparated and diſtinguiſhed from the Idolatrous Nations, and kept forty Years in the Wilderneſs, to hinder them from all communication with them, and to cure them of the proneneſs which they had to imitate them. If it be ſuppoſed, that the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were hated and deſpiſed by other Nations, would be very unlikely to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by them: it may be obſerved, that they were not always thus deſpiſed, nor among all Nations, but they were better eſteemed till the latter Ages of their Government; and then the reaſon of their being ill thought of, was, becauſe they were ſingular in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Points of Worſhip: and reſolute and zealous in the obſervation of it, and would make no compliances with the Heathen World; for they preſerved themſelves free from all Idolatry after their Captivity in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi> But however hated and contemned they might be; yet the ſame Authors who acquaint us with it, expreſs their own ſence, rather than the ſence of the reſt of Mankind: for at the ſame time they tell us, that they gained every where Proſelytes. The <hi>Greeks</hi> were likewiſe ever deſpiſed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> but ever imitated; and we have now an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a neighbour Nation, which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally both imitated and ſpoken againſt.

The Oracles aſcrib'd to the <hi>Sybils</hi> are ſo plain and ſo particular, that if they ſhould be admitted for genuine, not only the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations made to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but all the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion muſt be fully diſcover'd to the <hi>Heathen;</hi> but their Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has been the Cauſe why their Authority has been much queſtion'd; which yet ought not wholly to be rejected, ſince the Sibylline Oracles were preſerv'd in the Capitol, till the Reign of <hi>Honorius,</hi> when they were burnt by <hi>Stilico:</hi> And it is not to be imagin'd, that <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and other Chriſtians, would cite Oracles which were in the Poſſeſſion of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61773:105"/>thoſe againſt whom they cited them, unleſs they had been able to make good their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. This is a Subject which has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd the Pens of many Learned Men. I ſhall here ſet down what appears to me moſt probable upon the Queſtion, as briefly as I can.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is evident from <hi>Virgil,</hi> that in the Verſes of the <hi>Sibyl</hi> of <hi>Cuma,</hi> the Birth of ſome Great Perſon was foretold; and from <hi>Tully,</hi> that this Perſon was to be a <hi>King:</hi> Though both in <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy be miſapply'd to a wrong Perſon. The Fourth Eclogue of <hi>Virgil</hi> contains the Senſe of the <hi>Sibyl;</hi> and however it were deſign'd by him, is in moſt things much more applicable to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> than to the Perſon whom he deſcribes.</p>

                           </note> the Sibylline Oracles. And from the ſame Oracles, as well as from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it is probable, the Expectation of a King, who ſhould ariſe out of <hi>Judaea,</hi> which both <hi>Suetonius</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> mention,

                        <p>What <hi>Tully</hi> ſays, [<hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Divin.</hi>] in Diſparagement of this Oracle, is not much conſiderable in the Caſe; becauſe that whole Book is written with a Deſign to diſparage all Divination in general: For being an Academic, as he profeſſes throughout his
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61773:105"/>Books of Philoſophy, he acknowledg'd no more of any Part of their Religion, than was juſt neceſſary to comply with the Laws, as he owns himſelf in divers Places. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, from him it appears that a Sybylline Oracle was alledg'd to the Purpoſe there mentioned; and that being in Favour of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and of Monarchy, if there had been no other, was Cauſe enough for <hi>Tully</hi> to reject it, and turn it to ridicule.</p>

                        <p>But if theſe were only Heathen Oracles, yet there is Reaſon to believe that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions concerning <hi>Chriſt</hi> were very plain, though not ſo particular as thoſe now ſet down in the Sibylline Books; both becauſe the Heathen having but few Oracles of this Nature, and ſo many of a quite contrary Nature, it was the more neceſſary that theſe ſhould be plain; and becauſe we find, that when God, in his Infinite Wiſdom, ſaw it fitting to reveal himſelf to others, he did it in as plain a Manner, and ſometimes in a plainer, than he did to his own People in any one Prophecy.</p>
                        <p>Thus <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Prophecy is as plain as any Prophecy of that time at leaſt; and our Saviour diſcover'd himſelf more plainly to the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> than he had yet done to any of his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> iv. 26.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61773:107"/>might ordain, that theſe Celebrated Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſes, whoſe Oracles were otherwiſe the Devil's Inſtruments to promote his Ends, ſhould foretell our Saviour's Coming: And yet St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> aſſures us,

                        <p n="5">5. The Difference which there is between <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Fourth Eclogue, and the Tranſlation of it into <hi>Greek,</hi> in <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Oration, is rather an Argument <hi>for</hi> the Authority of the Sibylline Oracles, than againſt it. For <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> was wont to compoſe his <hi>Orations</hi> and <hi>Epiſtles</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> and they were Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into <hi>Greek</hi> by ſome whom be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in that Service: And the Author of the Tranſlation, Tranſlated only what was properly <hi>Virgil</hi>'s; but when he came to what was by <hi>Virgil</hi> borrow'd from the Sibyl, he wrote down the Original <hi>Greek,</hi> not tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating the Variations which <hi>Virgil</hi> had made from it, to apply the Prophecy to his own Subject.</p>
                        <p>It is well known that the Ancients took as great a Liberty as this, in their Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and it was the more allowable, when there could be no Deſign or Likelihood of Deceit in the Tranſlation of ſo Famous a Poem as that Eclogue of <hi>Virgil.</hi> This was but to point out the Alterations which
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61773:108"/>
                           <hi>Virgil</hi> had made, and to ſhew how eaſily theſe Parts of his Poem might be ſupply'd from the Original Greek: And perhaps this was a known Tranſlation of that Eclogue, which had been made with this Deſign.</p>
                        <p>It were no difficult Matter to anſwer all the other Objections which are wont to be brought againſt the <hi>Sybilline Oracles,</hi> ſo far as the Notion here propos'd is concern'd in them. For though the Books which we have now, contain manifeſt Falſifications and Forgeries; yet there muſt have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing real, to give a Pretence and Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to ſo many elaborate Forgeries of this Nature, and that was the <hi>Sibylline Oracles</hi> mention'd in <hi>Tully, Salluſt, Virgil,</hi> &amp;c. We may therefore conclude, That the True Religion receiv'd a conſiderable Promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from theſe Oracles, which ſerv'd to awaken in the <hi>Gentiles</hi> an Expectation of a <hi>King</hi> to be born in <hi>Judaea.</hi>

Of late, the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> in the <hi>Malayan</hi> Tongue, and <hi>Grotius</hi> his excellent Book <hi>of the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion</hi> in <hi>Arabick,</hi> have been tranſlated and printed, at the Charge of the Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyle;</hi> and the firſt diſperſt over all the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> where the <hi>Malayan</hi> Language is uſed; and the latter, into all the Countries where <hi>Arabick</hi> is ſpoken.

                        <p>The ſumm of all is this. Before the <hi>Flood, Revelations</hi> were ſo frequent, and the Lives of Men ſo long, that no Man could be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Creation, and of the Providence of God in the Government of the World and the Duties required towards him. And in the firſt Ages after the Flood, God's Will
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61773:113"/>reveal'd to <hi>Noah,</hi> and the Precept given to him at his coming out of the Ark, muſt be well known to all the ſurviving World; and as ſoon as the Remembrance of them began to decay, and Men to fall into Idolatry, <hi>Abraham</hi> and the other Patriarchs were ſent into divers Countries, to proclaim God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to teſtifie againſt the Impiety of Idolaters, where-ever they came. For, to publiſh the Reveal'd Will of God, and make it generally known in the World, God was pleas'd to chuſe to himſelf a peculiar People, and to ſend them firſt out of <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and, upon occaſion, back again into <hi>Meſopotamia;</hi> and then ſeveral times into <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> and from thence, after they had dwelt there ſome Hundreds of Years, into <hi>Canaan</hi> again; at what time he appointed them Laws, admirably fitted and contriv'd for the receiving of <hi>Strangers</hi> and <hi>Proſelytes.</hi> After many ſignal Victories, and after other Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, they were carry'd away captive to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and were ſtill deliver'd and reſtor'd by a Wonderful and Miraculous Providence, and had vaſt numbers of <hi>Proſelytes</hi> in all Parts of the known World, and many Footſteps and Remainders of the True Religion are found in the remoteſt Parts of the Earth. And when, by the juſt Judgment of God upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> for their Sin, in rejecting the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> they were rejected by him, from being his People, they were diſpers'd throughout the World, for
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61773:114"/>a Teſtimony to all Nations, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets deliver'd no other thing than what God had reveal'd to them; ſince they continue to maintain and aſſert thoſe very Books which plainly foretell all that Ruine and Deſtruction that has befallen them for their Infidelity and Diſobedience. They are a ſtanding Evidence, in all Parts of the World, of the Truth of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> bearing that Curſe which their Fore-fathers ſo many Ages ago imprecated upon themſelves and their Poſterity, when they caus'd <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify'd. And the Goſpel has, by its own Power and Evidence, manifeſted it ſelf to all People diſpers'd over the Face of the whole Earth. To which might be added, That the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi> owning ſo much of the Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd both in the Old and New Teſtament, afford ſome kind of Teſtimony to the Truth of it, in thoſe vaſt Dominions of which they are poſſeſs'd. All the moſt remarkable Diſpenſations of Providence, in the ſeveral Changes in the World, have had a particular Influence in the Propagation of the True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. <hi>Cyrus, Alexander the Great,</hi> divers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, and of latter Times, <hi>Tamerlain,</hi> and ſeveral other Princes, were great <hi>Favourers</hi> of it; and the worſt of Men, and the moſt unlikely Accidents, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed towards the Promotion of it.</p>
                        <p>If it be Objected, <hi>That notwithſtanding all which has been ſaid, great Part of the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61773:114"/>World are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers.</hi> Let it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That there is no Nation but has great Opportunities of being converted; and it is evident, from what has been produc'd concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Chineſe</hi> and the <hi>Americans</hi> themſelves, that the Chriſtian Religion had been preach'd among them, tho' the Knowledge of it was loſt, through their own Fault before the late Diſcoveries of thoſe Parts of the World. And as Chriſt came into the World <hi>in the fulneſs of time;</hi> ſo, <hi>in the fulneſs of time,</hi> that is, at the moſt fitting ſeaſon, he reveal'd himſelf to the ſeveral Nations of it. God, who is infinitely gracious to all, and knows the Hearts and Diſpoſitions of all Men, might defer the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring his Goſpel to the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> for Inſtance, till that very time when he ſaw them beſt prepar'd for it: And it is remarkable, That the Diſcovery of the <hi>Indies</hi> happen'd about the time of the Reformation; that thoſe poor People might have the Purity, as well as the Truth of Religion, if Chriſtians had been as little wanting to them in their Charity, as God has been in the Diſpoſals of his Providence. He ſtays till they have <hi>filled up the meaſure of their iniquities,</hi> before he <hi>puniſhes</hi> a People; and for the ſame Reaſons, of Mercy and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he waits for the moſt proper ſeaſons to impart his Revealed Will to them; and to have it preach'd to them before, would be only to encreaſe their Condemnation. And it
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61773:115"/>is not only Juſt, but Merciful, for him to with-hold the Knowledge of his Reveal'd Will from thoſe who, he forefees, would reject it, and abuſe the Opportunities which ſhould be offer'd them, to the Aggravation of their own Guilt and Puniſhment. Eſpecially if it be obſerv'd.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That as to particular Perſons, we have reaſon to believe, that God, who by ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful a Providence has taken care that every Nation under Heaven might have the True Religion preach'd in it, and who has the whole World at his Diſpoſal, and orders all things with great regard to the Salvation of Men; we have abundant cauſe to think, that he would, by ſome of the various Methods of his Providence, or even by Miracle, bring ſuch Men to the knowledge of the Truth, who live according to their preſent Knowledge, with a ſincere and honeſt Endeavour to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it. When St. <hi>Peter</hi> was by Revelation ſent to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> he made this Inference from it, <hi>Of a truth I perceive that God is no reſpecter of perſons: but in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh Righteouſneſs, is accepted with him,</hi> Act. x. 34, 35. From whence, what leſs can we conclude, than that every Man, in any part of the World, who is ſincerely good and pious in the Practice of his Duty, ſo far as it is known to him, ſhall rather, by an expreſs Revelation, have the reſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to him, as in the Inſtance of <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
                           <pb n="143" facs="tcp:61773:115"/>which gave occaſion to theſe words of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> than that he ſhould be ſuffer'd to periſh, for want of a true Faith, and ſufficient Knowledge of his Duty? And it is Juſt with God, to puniſh thoſe Heathens who ſin without any Reveal'd Law, for their Sins againſt Natural Reaſon and Conſcience, and for neglecting to uſe and improve their Reaſon, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Opportunities afforded them of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Chriſtians. We may likewiſe be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that beſides Natural Reaſon and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, God in his Goodneſs is not wanting to afford ſuch inward Motions and Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Mind to ſuch of the Heathen as are not wilfully blind and ſtupify'd by their Vices, as may prepare them for the reception of the Goſpel, which, by his Providence, he gives them ſo many Opportunities of becoming ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted withal: And if once they do diſcern the Defects and Faults of their own Religions, which are ſo groſly againſt Natural Reaſon and Conſcience, they may make enquiry of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> concerning their Religion, as ſome of the <hi>Americans</hi> did of <hi>Cortes</hi>'s; and the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> (ſome of them at leaſt) however neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent they be in propagating it, would never refuſe to inſtruct them in it. And it muſt be remembred, that among thoſe who have not receiv'd the True Religion, yet many Points are taught and believ'd which had their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from Revelation, as is evident not only of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> but of ſeveral <hi>Heathen</hi>
                           <pb n="144" facs="tcp:61773:116"/>Nations; which Points are ſo many Steps and <hi>Preparatives</hi> towards the Reception of the whole Truth, if they be not wanting to themſelves, in purſuing them in their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Tendency and Conſequences.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not ſay, That the Merits of Chriſt, and the Salvation of the Goſpel, do extend to thoſe who in the Integrity of their Hearts dye under an invincible Ignorance of it; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve rather, that God ſuffers no Man ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd and diſpos'd, to remain in invincible Ignorance. But it is ſufficient to vindicate God's Juſtice and Goodneſs, that all Nations have had ſuch Opportunities of coming to the Knowledge of the Truth; and great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances may be made at the Laſt Day, for the Ignorance and unhappy Circumſtances of particular Men. It was well ſaid, That when God hath not thought fit to tell us how he will be pleas'd to deal with ſuch Perſons, it is not fit for us to tell Him how he ought to deal with them. But if it be difficult for us now, to <hi>think</hi> how it will pleaſe God to deal with the <hi>Heathen,</hi> it would be a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more difficult to conceive how the Gracious and Merciful God could Govern and Judge the World, if all Mankind were in the State of <hi>Heathens,</hi> without any Divine Revelation.</p>
                        <p>What will become of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> as to their Eternal State, is not the Subject of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, nor doth it concern us to know;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61773:116"/>ſome of them will have more to plead for themſelves, in point of ignorance, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers can have; and they are in the hands of the Merciful Creator and Saviour of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and there we muſt leave them. But it muſt be acknowledged, that it is much more agreeable to the Goodneſs and Mercy of God, to reveal his Will, and to give ſo many Opportunities to the World to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in it, though never ſo many ſhould neglect the Means of Salvation; than it is to ſuppoſe him to take no care to reduce Mankind to the ſenſe and practice of Vertue and Religion, but to let them continue in all manner of Idolatry and Wickedneſs, without giving them any warning againſt it. <hi>I have not ſpoken in ſecret, in a dark place of the earth. Look unto me, and be ye ſaved all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none elſe. Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not ſpoken in ſecret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I:</hi> Iſa. xlv. 19, 22. &amp; xlviii. 16.</p>
                        <p>Having proved, That the Scriptures want nothing requiſite to a <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> in regard either of the <hi>Antiquity</hi> or <hi>Promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> I proceed to ſhew, That they have <hi>ſufficient Evidence,</hi> both by <hi>Prophecies</hi> and <hi>Miracles,</hi> in proof of their <hi>Authority.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This <hi>Evidence</hi> depends upon Matter of Fact, which concerns either the <hi>Prophecies</hi>
                           <pb n="146" facs="tcp:61773:117"/>and <hi>Miracles</hi> themſelves, in their ſeveral cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as we find them ſtand Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; or the Lives and Perſonal Qualifications of thoſe by whom they were performed, or by whom they are related in the Scriptures. For if we can be aſſured both that they are truly related, and that, if they were done as they are related, they could proceed from none but a Divine Power; we have all the Evidence for the Truth of the Scriptures that can be had for a Revelation.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron.</head>
                        <p>THat <hi>Moſes</hi> was a very Great and Wiſe Man, is related by ſeveral of the moſt eminent Heathen Writers; and I think it has never been denied by any Man. But it is no leſs evident, that he was likewiſe a very Good and Pious Man. He frequently declares his own Failings and Infirmities, <hi>Exod.</hi> iii. 11. &amp; iv. 1, 10, 13. <hi>Num.</hi> xi. 10. &amp; xx. 12. &amp; xxvii. 14. and never ſpeaks any thing tending to his own Praiſe, but upon a juſt and neceſſary occaſion, when it might become a prudent and modeſt Man, eſpecially one Divinely Inſpired: For all the Praiſe of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61773:117"/>ſuch an one doth not terminate in himſelf, but is attributed to God, whoſe Inſtrument and Servant he is; and in ſuch caſes where God's Honour is concerned, it was a Duty to ſet forth the Favour and Goodneſs of God towards him, though ſome Honour did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to himſelf thereby. The greateſt Maſters of Decency have not thought it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways improper for Men to commend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, either becauſe they ſuppoſed ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions might require it, or becauſe it was a more uſual thing in ancient Times, when Mens Lives and Manners were more natural and ſincere; and they oftner ſpoke as they thought both of themſelves and others; yet we no where find Men ſpeaking ſo freely in diſparagement of themſelvs as in the Holy Scriptures: Which ſhews, that <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the reſt of the Inſpired Writers, little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded their own Praiſe or Diſpraiſe, but wrote what God was pleaſed to appoint; it being a thing indifferent to them, ſo God might be honoured, whether they loſt or gained in their own Reputation by it. But what we read of <hi>Moſes, Num.</hi> xii. 3. that he was <hi>very meek above all the Men which were upon the face of the Earth,</hi> which is the only commendable Character that <hi>Moſes</hi> gives of himſelf, may be tranſlated, that he was the moſt <hi>afflicted Man,</hi> (according to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Reading;) and if he mentions his own Meekneſs, he mentions alſo his <hi>great Anger,</hi>
                           <pb n="148" facs="tcp:61773:118"/>or <hi>heat of Anger, Exod.</hi> xi. 8. and his being <hi>very wroth, Num.</hi> xvi. 15. But if <hi>Moſes</hi> had not had more reſpect to Truth, than to his own Reputation, he would never have left it upon Record, That he ſo often declined the Meſſage and Employment which God appointed him to undertake, <hi>Exod.</hi> iii. 11, 13. &amp; iv. 1, 10, 13, 14. and that God was angry with him upon other occaſions, and for that reaſon would not permit him to enter into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Land: He would certainly have aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Prophecy, and <hi>Jethro</hi>'s Advice, to himſelf; at leaſt he would never have Recorded, That by <hi>Jethro</hi>'s Counſel, he took up a new and better Method for the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Juſtice: If he had been led by Ambition and Vain-glory, he would have endeavoured, by theſe things, to adorn his own Character; and would never have leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen'd it, by telling his own Infirmities at the ſame time, when, to the diminution of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he publiſhes the Excellencies of others. The Wonders of the Magicians of <hi>Aegypt</hi> are not concealed by him: and being to give an account of his own Genealogy from <hi>Levi,</hi> he firſt ſets down the Families of <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Simeon,</hi> the two elder Brothers, leſt he might ſeem to arrogate too much to himſelf, and his own Tribe. Some have obſerved, that <hi>Moſes</hi> relates his own Birth to have been by a Marriage contrary to the Laws afterwards by himſelf eſtabliſhed: which indeed is
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61773:118"/>doubtful, by reaſon of the latitude of ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the word <hi>Siſter</hi> in the Hebrew Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: yet it is certain, he was not careful to avoid the being thought to have been born from ſuch a Marriage; as he would have been, if his Laws had been of his own contrivance, leſt his own Reputation, or the Authority of his Laws, or perhaps both, might have ſuffered by it, <hi>Exod.</hi> vi. 14, 20. He ſets forth the Ingratitude, Idolatry, and perpetual Revolts and Murmurings of his whole Nation, and relates the Failings and Faults of their Anceſtors the Patriarchs, and particularly of <hi>Levi,</hi> from whom he was deſcended, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxiv. 30. &amp; xlix. 6. He ſpares neither his People, nor his Anceſtors, nor himſelf, in what he relates; and theſe are all the Characters of a faithful Hiſtorian, and a ſincere Man, that can be deſired.</p>
                        <p>And as <hi>Moſes</hi> was not ambitious of Praiſe, ſo neither was he ambitious of Power and Dominion. For beſides that he entered upon ſuch an Undertaking, as no ſober Man would have attempted without a Revelation, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing otherwiſe impoſſible to accompliſh it, his whole Conduct ſhews, that he had no deſign of advancing his own Intereſt or Dominion. If he had been never ſo Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, he needed not have gone into the Wilderneſs to ſeek his Preferment, amongſt a wandring and ſtubborn People, when he had been bred up to all the Honours and the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61773:119"/>Pleaſures that <hi>Aegypt</hi> or <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court could afford: but he <hi>refuſed to be called the ſon of Pharaoh's daughter; chuſing rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon; eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures of Aegypt,</hi> Heb. xi. 24, 25. He undertook to lead the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for Forty Years, through a barren Wilderneſs; where he could promiſe himſelf but a very uneaſie and inglorious Reign, if that had been his Deſign; and, by the courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he could not hope to out-live that period of Time: and tho' he was preſerved, in his Old Age, in the full ſtrength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of Manhood; yet, upon their entrance into the <hi>promiſed Land,</hi> he meekly reſigned himſelf to death, in the very ſight and Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Canaan;</hi> knowing before-hand that he muſt not be ſuffered to poſſeſs the Land which he had been ſo many years, in ſo great dangers, leading the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to enjoy; though he doth not conceal how deſirous he was to paſs over <hi>Jordan, Deut.</hi> iii. 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Hiſtory of his Death is like that of his Life, related with a peculiar kind of native ſimplicity: He is not ſaid to be taken up into Heaven, as <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> were, and as the <hi>Romans</hi> feigned of <hi>Romulus;</hi> but to <hi>die;</hi> and his Sepulchre was hid, to prevent the Superſtitious and Idolatrous Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration which might have been paid to the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61773:119"/>Remains of ſo great a Perſon. And tho' he had Sons, yet they were but private Men, no otherwiſe known to us, than as they were his Sons; the Government he conferred upon <hi>Joſhua,</hi> one of another Tribe. <hi>Moſes</hi> therefore was the furtheſt of any Man from Vain-glorious, or Ambitious and Aſpiring Deſigns; and could propoſe no other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to himſelf, but the fulfilling the Will of God, in delivering his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and following his Directions in his Conduct and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Aaron</hi> was of a different Temper from <hi>Moſes,</hi> and was envious of him, and both <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> murmured againſt him. It is ſo notorious, that there could be no Contrivance between them to deceive the People; that it was the immediate and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Power of God, which kept <hi>Aaron,</hi> as well as the reſt, in Obedience to <hi>Moſes.</hi> Upon <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Abſence, <hi>Aaron</hi> complied with the People, in making a Golden Calf; and his two eldeſt Sons offered ſtrange Fire before the Lord, which he had not commanded; for which they were both deſtroyed by Fire miraculouſly iſſuing out from the Preſence of the Lord: And <hi>Aaron held his peace,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this Puniſhment was inflicted by God himſelf, and having nothing to reply to <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he declared to him the Juſtice of it. And both <hi>Aaron</hi> and his other two
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61773:120"/>Sons are forbidden, upon pain of Death, to mourn for them, <hi>Lev.</hi> x. 1, 2, 3, 6. At laſt, by the Commandment of God, <hi>Aaron</hi> goes up into <hi>Mount Hor,</hi> to die there, not being permitted to enter into the <hi>Land of Promiſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were ſometimes at diſagreement, <hi>Aaron</hi> envying <hi>Moſes: Aaron</hi> loſt two of his Sons, by a ſignal Judgment from Heaven; and <hi>Moſes</hi> advanced neither of his; and both <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> died by the particular Appointment and Command of God, for their Offences againſt him, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enjoying, nor, for a long time before, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to enjoy the <hi>Land of Promiſe.</hi> And therefore, as they could never have performed what they did, but by the Almighty Power of God; ſo they could have no Motive or Inducement to attempt it, but his Command and Promiſe of Aſſiſtance revealed to them.</p>

                        <p>AS the Books entitled to <hi>Moſes</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by all to be of the greateſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity; ſo we have it confirmed to us, by the Authority of <hi>Heathen</hi> Writers themſelves, that the Books which go under his Name,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61773:120"/>are indeed of his writing; beſides the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Teſtimony of the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ever ſince <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Time, from the firſt writing of them: Which is infinitely better Proof of their being Authentick, and entitl'd to the true Author, than can be pretended for any Books but the Holy Scriptures. Divers Texts of the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> imply, that it was written by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and the Book of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> as well as other Books of Scripture, import as much; and though ſome Paſſages have been thought to imply the contrary; yet this is but a late Opinion, and has been ſufficiently confuted by Learned Men.</p>
                        <p>It is obſervable, whoever wrote theſe Five Books, that there is no Partiality ſhewn to any one whomſoever. <hi>Noah</hi> is ſaid to be overcome with Wine, and expos'd to the Mockery of one of his Sons. <hi>Lot</hi> is deſcrib'd not only to have been drunken, but to have lain with his own Daughters. <hi>Abraham</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf denies his Wife twice; and <hi>Iſaac</hi> imitates him in it. <hi>Jacob</hi> gets the Bleſſing, by Fraud and Subtilty, from his Brother <hi>Eſau. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>'s Brethren ſell him into <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and he, when he is there, learns to ſwear <hi>By the Life of Pharaoh.</hi> The Faults of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and of <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, (as I have already obſerv'd) are not conceal'd. On the other ſide, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Notice is taken how <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> bleſs'd <hi>Abraham,</hi> and receiv'd Tythes of him: <hi>And without all contradiction, the leſs is bleſſed
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61773:121"/>of the better,</hi> Heb. vii. 7. The Advice of <hi>Jethro</hi> is recorded; and the Prophecies of <hi>Balaam</hi> himſelf are punctually ſet down. It was no Deſign of the Sacred Pen-Man to write a Panegyrick upon any Man, but to repreſent the Failings and Infirmities, as well as the Excellencies of each Perſon; and to ſhew by what various Methods the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God brought to paſs his gracious Deſigns; how he turn'd Evil into Good, and made uſe even of the Infirmities and Sins of Men, to accompliſh his Purpoſes.</p>
                        <p>In the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> we have a ſhort Account of the moſt Memorable and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Things which had paſt to the Times of <hi>Moſes;</hi> as the Creation of the World, the Inſtitution of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> the Fall of Man, the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> of Offering Sacrifices as Types of his Death: Who firſt committed Murther, and who firſt brought in Polygamy; the Inventon of divers Arts, the Flood, the Confuſion of Tongues; the Original of the ſeveral Nations of the World, with the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology of the whole; all which is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in a little Compaſs, but a larger and more particular Account is given of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Family: For here the Scene begins to open to the main Deſign of the Work, the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> being as an Introduction to the reſt of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> and containing ſuch things as were requiſite to be premis'd.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61773:121"/>And in the beginning of the Hiſtory of <hi>Abraham,</hi> it is noted, that the <hi>Canaanite was then in the land,</hi> Gen. xii. 6. even at that very time when <hi>Abraham</hi> erected an Altar to the Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. this being a great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to excite them to follow the Example of their Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> who worſhipp'd the True God, in a publick and ſolemn Manner, in that Land which they were now going to poſſeſs, and amongſt that People which they were now to drive out, and which, at that time when the Land was promis'd them, were the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of it; and God, who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected <hi>Abraham</hi> in ſo ſignal a Manner, would no leſs aſſiſt them.</p>
                        <p>And if we conſider thoſe things particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, wherein <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf is concen'd as an Agent, as well as an Hiſtorian, there can be no Pretence for any Man to doubt, but that at leaſt the principal Points of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Moſes</hi> are true; that is, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Governor or General of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who conducted them out of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> that they travell'd for many Years in the Wilderneſs; that they fought divers Battels with the ſeveral Nations who oppos'd their Journeying into the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and, that <hi>Moſes</hi> gave them the Laws which we find there recorded. Theſe are the chief Points of the Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which are, as it were, the Foundation of all the reſt;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61773:122"/>the reſt being but as Circumſtances to ſhew the Manner of doing it, and the Power by which all this was done. And that theſe main Points are true, it was never deny'd by thoſe <hi>Heathens</hi> themſelves who moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd and vilify'd the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation: They acknowledg'd that <hi>Moſes</hi> was the great General and Law-Giver of the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> they own'd that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> came out of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> they could deny nothing of the Hiſtory it ſelf, but only gave wrong Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, partly out of Ignorance, and partly out of Malice and Deſign, of the Manner and Means by which this was effected, and the Reaſons and Occaſions upon which it came to paſs. From the Books of <hi>Joſephus againſt Apion,</hi> in which he gives an Account of what the moſt Ancient Authors of other Nations have deliver'd concerning the <hi>Jews;</hi> and from what the latter Heathens, <hi>Strabo, Tacitus, Juſtin,</hi> and others; after the <hi>Jews</hi> became ſo odious and contemptible in the eyes of all Nations, have written; it is evident, that the great and fundamental Points, as to the Matters of Fact, are confeſs'd; and the only Diſpute is concerning the Manner in which they were brought about, and the Means whereby all was effected.</p>
                        <p>Now we take the Hiſtories of all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, rather from themſelves, than from Foreigners and Strangers to their Affairs, or profeſſed Enemies; and it were extreme Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:61773:122"/>to admit the Accounts we have of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Affairs, from Authors who liv'd ſo much too late to have any certain Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the things they write about, and who, upon every Occaſion, ſhew ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection to their Name and Nation, and contradict each other, and themſelves too, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſhews; it would, I ſay, be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Partiality to follow ſuch Authors, rather than credit the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Records atteſted and deliver'd down to us by the unanimous Approbation and Teſtimony of the whole Nation.</p>
                        <p>And when I come to conſider the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wrought by <hi>Moſes,</hi> I ſhall prove, That they were of that Nature, and perform'd in ſuch a Manner, as that they could not be feign'd or counterfeit at firſt, nor the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given of them in the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd afterwards; and therefore theſe Five Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt be Genuine, and of Divine Authority, being written by him who had ſo many ways given Evidence of his Divine Commiſſion.</p>

Theſe ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies we have recorded in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and aſcribed to others; and the laſt, comaining ſo many remarkable things, is from the mouth of an Enemy.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf foretold, That the <hi>Children of Iſrael</hi> ſhould, after Forty Years, come into the <hi>Land of Promiſe;</hi> That they ſhould prove Victorious over the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> and, That their Country ſhould, by the Divine Care and Protection, be preſerved in ſafety, whilſt they went up to worſhip at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> thrice every Year: <hi>Thrice in the year ſhall all your men-children appear before the Lord God, the God of Iſrael: For I will caſt out the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before thee, and enlarge thy borders; net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall any man deſire thy land, when thou ſhalt go up to appear before the Lord thy God, thrice in the year,</hi> Exod. xxxiv. 23, 24. Here is the Promiſe of a conſtant Miracle to be fulfilled to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> thrice every Year as long as their Government ſtood; all their Males were to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at three ſet and known times, every year; and yet their Enemies round about them, whom they had ſo many ways provoked, were, by the Almighty Power of God, reſtrained from taking any advantage of this opportunity, which was frequently and notoriouſly given them, of Invading their Countrey. The very Nature and Conſtitution of the Jewiſh
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:61773:126"/>worſhip, made it impoſſible for their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſubſiſt in the obſervation of their Religion, without a Miracle wrought three times in a Year for their preſervation. And the fulfilling of this Promiſe, which God had made to them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of them in the performance of that Worſhip which he had appointed them, was a continual Confirmation of his Law, and a repeated Aſſurance that it was from God.</p>
                        <p>By the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> likewiſe, every Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Year they were Permitted neither to ſow their Land, nor to prune their Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, nor to gather any Corn or Fruits that grew of their own accord: which was a Law that muſt have brought them under great extremities, and the obſervation of it had been impracticable, if the extraordinary and miraculous Bleſſing of God had not ſupplied this conſtant want of the ſeventh year's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, with as conſtant an Overplus in the preceeding years. For as God, by <hi>Moſes,</hi> foretold, That on the Sixth Day there ſhould fall Manna enough to ſupply them on the <hi>Sabbath-day;</hi> ſo they had a Promiſe of Three Years Fruits preciſely every Sixth Year, to ſupply that want which the Sabbatical Year muſt otherwiſe have reduced them to: <hi>And if ye ſhall ſay, What ſhall we eat the ſeventh year; behold, we ſhall not ſow, nor gather in our encreaſe: Then I will command my bleſſing
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61773:126"/>upon you in the ſixth year, and it ſhall bring forth fruit for three years. And ye ſhall ſow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit, until the ninth year, until her fruits come in, ye ſhall eat of the old ſtore,</hi> Lev. xxv. 20, 21, 22. Which is another clear Inſtance, that the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could never have ſubſiſted in the obſervation of their Law, but by the conſtant and miraculous accompliſhment of the Prophecies, which contained the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made to them for their Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>In bleſſing the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he foretold the peculiar ſtate and condition of every diſtinct Tribe, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxiii. He foretold to them all in general, That they ſhould have miraculous ſucceſs againſt the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> That they ſhould poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their Land; That they ſhould ſet Kings over them; That they ſhould have a peculiar Place of Worſhip, whither they ſhould all reſort; and that they ſhould have the Divine Oracles, and a ſucceſſion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, for their direction in all Matters of great importance and difficulty. And <hi>Joſhua</hi> appeals to the Experience of the <hi>children of Iſrael,</hi> whether all had not been fulfilled which was promiſed, as far as his time: <hi>And be hold this day I am going the way of all the earth; and ye know in all your hearts, and in all your ſouls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the Lord your God
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:61773:127"/>ſpake concerning you: all are come to paſs unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof,</hi> Joſh. xxiii. 14. The extent of the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the <hi>children of Iſrael,</hi> after they came to be ſetled in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> is foretold, <hi>Exod.</hi> xxiii. 31. and fulfilled, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> viii. 3. <hi>Ezra</hi> iv. 20. And <hi>Solomon</hi> at the Dedication of the Temple, declared in the audience of all the People. That <hi>there had not failed one word of all God's good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which he promiſed by the hand of Moſes his ſervant,</hi> 1 King. viii. 56.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo foretold, that beſides a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſucceſſion of Prophets, for many Ages there ſhould ariſe a Prophet of extraordinary Power and Authority; and whoſoever would not hear that Prophet, ſhould be deſtroyed <hi>Deut.</hi> xviii. 18. This Prophet was the great expectation of the <hi>Jews</hi> at the time of out Saviour's coming, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.21. &amp; vi. 14. &amp; vii. 40. and the Apoſtles prove our Saviour to be him, <hi>Act.</hi> iii. 22. &amp; vii. 37. Laſtly, <hi>Moſes</hi> foretold the Diſobedience and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of the <hi>children of Iſrael,</hi> the Judgments that ſhould befall them for their Iniquities and their Deliverance upon their Repentance he foretold ſo many Years before they had any King, That they, and <hi>their King whom they would ſet over them,</hi> ſhould be carried into Captivity; and that at the ſame time, when they were taken Captive by the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> who are deſcribed in the very ſame
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:61773:127"/>words that the other Prophets uſe concerning them, the remainder ſhould be carried into <hi>Aegypt, Deut.</hi> xxviii. 36, 49, 50, 68. and we ſee it came accordingly to paſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> xliii. And the Siege of <hi>Samaria</hi> by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> both by them and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> is particularly deſcribed to the very circumſtance of their <hi>eating the fleſh of their ſons, and of their daughters,</hi> Deut. xxviii. 53. which is a thing that has ſcarce ever happen'd in any other Siege but thoſe of <hi>Samaria</hi> and of <hi>Jeruſalem, Lam.</hi> ii. 20. &amp; iv. 10.2 <hi>King.</hi> vi. 29. This monſtrous and dreadful thing was twice known in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> firſt, when it was beſieged by <hi>Nehuchadnezzar;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, when it was deſtroyed by the <hi>Romans</hi> under <hi>Titus:</hi> And ſuch a circumſtance could not be foretold ſo long before, but by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Preſcience; and that ſo ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural a thing ſhould befall the <hi>Children of Iſrael</hi> three ſeveral times, according to the expreſs words of a Prophecy, could have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Chance in it.</p>
                        <p>Thus we ſee, that beſides the Prophecies concerning the other Nations of the Earth, every State and Condition of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from their firſt Original, to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was the Perpetual Fulfilling of expreſs Prophecies contained in the Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi>

                        <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of the Miracles wrought by</hi> Moſes.</head>
                        <p>IF it be once proved, That <hi>Moſes</hi> did what is related of him in the <hi>Pentateuch;</hi> it will unavoidably follow, That he did it by a Divine Power, and that he was God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and Miniſter; and that therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he did or wrote, as by his Direction and Command, was really ſo. For if there ever were or can be any ſuch thing as a <hi>Miracle,</hi> it muſt be confeſſed, that the Works performed by <hi>Moſes</hi> were ſuch; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the only Enquiry will be, Whether they were really performed by Him; ſince it is abſurd to think, that God may not, upon great Reaſons, alter the courſe of Nature.</p>
                        <p>And I ſhall undertake to prove, ſuppoſing only that there was ſuch a Man as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that the Jewiſh Law was given by him, That it is of Divine Authority, and ſtands confirmed by all the Miracles which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> to have been wrought by <hi>Moſes.</hi> And that there was ſuch a man, and that he delivered the Law to the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> is affirmed by the beſt Heathen Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, as <hi>Diodorus Siculus, Strabo,</hi> and others and was never yet, that I have heard of queſtion'd by any Man: For thoſe who will
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61773:128"/>not acknowledge that <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote the Books which contain it, yet confeſs that the Law it ſelf was of his preſcribing. But if it ſhould be queſtion'd, whether there ever was ſuch a Man, who gave them their Law; how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd is it to imagine, that a new and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome Law, which at firſt was ſo very uneaſie to them, and which nothing but a full perſunſion of its Divine Authority could ever have made them ſo zealous for, ſhould be received by any Nation, merely upon a feigned and groundleſs Report, that <hi>Moſes</hi> had, at ſome time or other, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it, in ſuch a manner, and in ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, if there never had been ſuch a Man, or ſuch a Law-giver in the World? Could any one, or more Men, perſuade a whole Nation to this? or could a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſpire to deceive their Poſterity with a belief of it? What mighty Charm could there be in a Name never heard of before, and in a Story newly invented, that a whole Nation ſhould preſently grow fond of it? They muſt conſider Humane Nature very little, who can fanſie any thing ſo unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall therefore take it for granted, that there was ſuch a Man as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that the Jewiſh Law was given by him: And if it be once proved, that the Matters of Fact, or Miracles related of him, were indeed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, as they are related to have been;
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:61773:129"/>no rational Man can doubt but that they were brought to paſs by an Almighty Power, I ſhall now therefore conſider the Hiſtory of the <hi>Jews</hi> barely as National Records, not as written by an Inſpired Author: For it will appear from them, conſidered only as an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Matter of fact, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Perſon inſpired and aſſiſted by God, and both wrote and did all by God's expreſs Will and Appointment. And if we queſtion the Authority of the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> in this matter, when they are conſidered but as National Records, it muſt be upon one of theſe accounts: Either, (1.) Becauſe the Matters of fact contained in them, as they are there related to have been done, were not at firſt ſufficiently atteſted. Or, (2.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Records themſelves are ſeigned, and therefore the Relations there ſet down are not to be depended upon. For if the Miracles be ſufficiently atteſted, ſuppoſing the Truth of the Hiſtory; then, if the Hiſtory be true, the Miracles muſt be ſo too.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Miracles and Matters of fact con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as they are there related to have been done, were at firſt ſufficiently atteſted. The permiſſion of Polygamy amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> for the encreaſe of that People; the peculiar Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Climate of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where the Women are obſerved to bring forth often
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:61773:129"/>two or three, ſometimes more Children at a birth; the long Lives of Mankind in thoſe Ages; and above all, the Promiſe of God, made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> That he would bleſs and multiply his Poſterity in <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Line, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxii. 17. cauſed the <hi>Children of Iſrael</hi> to be exceeding numerous, in a few Generations after they came into <hi>Aeygpt: A Syrian ready to periſh was their father; and he went down into Aeygpt, and ſojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty and populous,</hi> Deut. xxvi. 5. The fighting-Men, from twenty years old and upward, that were numbred in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Sinai,</hi> in the ſecond year after they came out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> were <hi>Six hundred thouſand, and Three thouſand and five hundred and fifty,</hi> beſides the Tribe of <hi>Levi, Num.</hi> i. 1, 46, 47. And the Males of the <hi>Levites</hi> that were numbred, from Thirty Years old to Fifty <hi>were Egtht thouſand and five hundred and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore,</hi> Num. iv. 47, 48. And the number of Males, from Twenty Years old and upward, which was taken in the Plains of <hi>Moab,</hi> was <hi>Six hundred thouſands and a thouſand ſeven hundred and thirty,</hi> beſides the <hi>Levites;</hi> and thoſe that were numbred of them, were <hi>Twenty and three thouſand, all males from a month old and upward,</hi> and <hi>not a man</hi> of theſe was numbred before <hi>in the wilderneſs of Sinai</hi> chap. xxvi. 51, 62, 64. And thoſe of the other Sex muſt be ſuppoſed to have been
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:61773:130"/>about the ſame number, when both theſe Accompts were taken: In all, reckoning Men, Women, and Children and Servants, the Number is computed at three Millions.</p>
                        <p>And all this People, the Parents, and the Children, who, as they died, grew up in their ſtead, were conducted for Forty Years together, by a conſtant courſe of Miracles wrought continually in their ſight. God <hi>took him a nation from the midſt of another nation, by temptations, by ſigns, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a ſtretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out arm, and by great terrours,</hi> Deut. iv. 34. They could not be ignorant, whether there were Miracles wrought to procure their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance out of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> theſe were publick and notorious both to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptians;</hi> the Magicians were not able to do the like with their Inchantments, but were forced to confeſs, <hi>This is the finger of God,</hi> Exod. viii. 19. and they were of that nature, and of ſuch mighty conſequence, that they could not fail of being particularly taken notice of, when two Nations were ſo much concerned in the Effects and Events of them. The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had been Witneſſes of Ten Plagues inflicted ſucceſſively upon the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> in the moſt remarkable manner that can be conceived, to procure their Deliverance; and when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> purſued them, as they were going away, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to eſcape from him but by

                        <p>We ſee how impoſſible it was for <hi>Moſes</hi> to impoſe upon the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in things of this nature; it he could have been ſo far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of all Reaſon and common Senſe, as to hope to do it. But if he had deſigned to put any deceit upon them, he would certainly have taken another courſe; he would have done his Miracles privately, and but ſeldom, not in the midſt of all the People, for Forty Years together: he would never have made two Nations, at the firſt, Witneſſes to them; and then have proceeded in ſuch a manner, as that every Man among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> muſt have known them to be falſe, if thy had been ſo: he would have choſen ſuch Inſtances to ſhew his Miracles in, as ſhould have provoked no body; not ſuch as muſt have enraged the whole People againſt him, by the death of ſo many thouſands, ſo often put to death, if they had been ſlain by any other means than by the Almighty Hand of God.

                        <p>We have other Evidence (as I have before obſerved) that <hi>Moſes</hi> had no deſign to delude the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from the Meekneſs of his Diſpoſition, from his diſcovering his own Faults and Infirmities in his Writings, and from his not advancing his Family, but leaving his Poſterity in a private condition, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Government into the hands of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> one of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim.</hi> But when all the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were Witneſſes to ſo many Miracles wrought by him, and particularly to ſo ſtrange a Judgment as the cleaving aſunder of the Earth, and the Fire and Plague by which ſo many thouſands periſhed; we need not inſiſt upon any other Proof to ſhew that the Miraculons Power and Divine Authority by which <hi>Moſes</hi> acted and wrote, was as well atteſted, and as fully known to the whole People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as it is poſſible for any Matter of Fact to be known to any ſingle Perſon.</p>

Having ſhewn, That the Matters of fact and Miracles contained in the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> as they are related to have been done, were at firſt ſufficiently atteſted; and that, if we may credit that Relation, all the Miracles there mention'd were certainly wrought by him; ſince they are of that nature, that the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not be deceived in them: I now proceed to ſhew, That the Relations there ſet down, are a true Account of thoſe things, and ſuch as we may depend upon. For if theſe Matters of Fact or Miracles are either feigned or falſified; this muſt be done either in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s his time, or afterwards, and if in his time, then either by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> with others who were concerned in carrying on the Deſign, or by the whole People of <hi>Iſra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if it were done after <hi>Moſes</hi> his death, then again it muſt be done either by ſome particular Man, or by the contrivance of ſome few or more together; or it muſt have been by the joint Knowledge and conſent of the whole Nation. I will therefore prove, (1.) That the Miracles could not be feigned by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and others concerned with them in carrying on ſuch a Deſign. (2.) The Miracles could not be feigned, nor the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> invented or falſified by any particular Man, or by any Confederacy or Combination of Men, after the death of <hi>Moſes.</hi> (3.) The Miracles could not be feigned, nor the Books invented or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified

                        <p n="1">1. Theſe Things could not be feigned by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and others concerned with them in carrying on ſuch a Deſign. It is plain, that they could never invent ſuch an Account as that of their miraculous Eſcape out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and their Travelling in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, under the conduct and ſupport of the ſame miraculous Power, and then impoſe it upon the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for Truth. For the People are ſuppoſed to be chiefly concerned in the whole Relation. <hi>Moſes</hi> appeals to their own ſenſe and experience; <hi>The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even with us, who are all of us here alive this day,</hi> Deut. v. 3. <hi>And know you this day: for I ſpeak not with your children which have not known, and which have not ſeen the chaſtiſement of the Lord your God, his greatneſs, his mighty hand, and his ſtretched-out arm, and his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and his acts which he did in the midſt of Aegypt, unto Pharaoh the king of Aegypt, and unto all his land; and what he did unto the army of Aegypt, unto their horſes, and to their chariots, how he made the water of the Red-ſea to over flow them as they purſued after you, and how the Lord hath deſtroyed them unto this day; and what he did unto you in the wilderneſs, until ye came into this place; and what he did unto Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than and Abiram, the ſons of Eliab, the ſon of Reuben; how the earth opened her mouth and

Here is a Recapitulation of all the Miracles that had been wrought, with an Appeal to their Senſes for the Truth of them: And <hi>Moſes</hi> would never have made ſuch Appeals as theſe, if they could poſſibly have diſproved him; they could never be perſuaded that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Though Men may, perhaps, be perſuaded to believe, that their Anceſtors, a long time ago, ſaw and heard things which they never ſaw nor heard, yet a whole Nation was never ſuppoſed to have been perſuaded out of their Senſes at once: and <hi>Moſes</hi> could not attempt to make ſo many Men believe what they muſt all have known to have been falſe, as well as himſelf, if it had been ſo; but he would have lard the Scene at a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time, and not have brought thoſe in as chiefly concerned in the whole buſineſs, who were then alive and preſent to convince him of falſhood: And therefore, if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars ſet down in the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> be falſe,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61773:141"/>and as ancient as <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, they muſt be invented with the knowledge, and received by the conſent of the whole Nation. For <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> could never ſo far delude ſo many thouſands, as to make them believe ſuch variety of Matter of fact, in ſo many and ſo wonderful Inſtances ſet forth, and with ſuch notorious Circumſtances, and appeal to the Senſes of thoſe whom they deceived, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had not ſeen and perceived, and had the experience of what had been done for ſo many years if it had been all but Fiction.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Miracles could not be feigned, nor the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> invented or falſified by any particular Man, or by any confederacy or combination of Men, after the death of <hi>Moſes.</hi> If the Miracles were feigned after the death of <hi>Moſes,</hi> either the Laws muſt likewiſe be invented or altered after his death, and the Miracles inſerted to procure them Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; or the Laws remained as they had been delivered by him, and the Miracles only were added. For the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> may be conſidered either as containing the Laws de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by him, or as relating the Miracles by which theſe Laws were ratified and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; in each of which reſpects there could be no Forgery or Falſification. For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Laws themſelves could not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, nor altered or falſified: becauſe the whole Jewiſh State and Policy was founded upon them, and could not ſubſiſt without
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61773:142"/>them; and therefore they muſt be as ancient as the Jewiſh Government, which is confeſs'd on all hands to have been firſt erected by <hi>Moſes.</hi> For not only their Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but their Civil Rights and Intereſts, depended entirely upon the Laws of <hi>Moſes;</hi> their Publick Proceedings, and their Private Dealings one with another, were all to be regulated and governed by theſe Laws: and when any Laws are brought into conſtant uſe and practice in any Nation, it is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to imagine that they can be altered and falſified, and a new Syſtem of Laws intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced inſtead of them, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the People governed by them, or any remembrances of it left amongſt them. No material Alterations can be made in Laws which are of continual uſe, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern every Man's Intereſt, but they muſt be taken notice of and diſcovered by ſuch as ſhall find themſelves aggrieved by ſuch Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. But this was leſs practicable amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> than amongſt any other People.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Diſtinction of their Tribes, and the Genealogies which were kept of every Family, made them have a more ſeparate and diſtinct Intereſt in every Tribe, and a more exact Account of Times and perfect Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things in every Family; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were not ſo capable of being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon in things of this nature, as the People of other Nations might be, where
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61773:142"/>Marriages and Inheritances are promiſcuous, and no occaſion is given for the like emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and watchfulneſs over one another, and where no ſuch Remembrances and Notices of the Tranſactions of Affairs are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted by any one of every private Family: <hi>In the wilderneſs of Sinai, on the firſt day of the ſecond month, in the ſecond year after they were come out of the land of Aegypt, Moſes and Aaron</hi> aſſembled <hi>all the congregations together, and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by the houſe of their fathers, according to the number of their names, from twenty years old and upward, by their poll,</hi> Num. i. 1, 18. and this was done again in the <hi>Plains of Moab,</hi> at the end of Forty Years, <hi>chap.</hi> xxvi. And theſe Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies we preſerved, not only during the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, <hi>Ezra</hi> vii. and down to the Reign of <hi>Herod,</hi> but even to the time of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who (in his Firſt Book againſt <hi>Apion</hi>) ſays, That they had the Genealogies of their Prieſts then ſtill extant for two thouſand Years.</p>
                        <p>By which means it came to paſs, that every Tribe had a kind of ſeparate Intereſt; which was the occaſion of <hi>Korah</hi>'s Sedition againſt <hi>Moſes.</hi> And every Man amongſt their Tribes might certainly hereby know how many Generations he was removed from thoſe who firſt took poſſeſſion of <hi>the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;</hi> and might find the Names of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors regiſtred, who were in the Wilderneſs with <hi>Moſes,</hi> or came with <hi>Joſhua</hi> over <hi>Jordan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                           <pb n="194" facs="tcp:61773:143"/>And this muſt make the memory of their Anceſtors more dear and familiar to them; and it muſt make them have a greater regard for any thing they had left behind them, eſpecially for a Book upon which their Rights of Inheritance, and the Title they had to all they enjoyed, depended: This was the Deed by which they held their Eſtates; and the Laſt Will and Teſtament, as it were, of their Anceſtors, amongſt whom the Land was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. But it is certain, Men are more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of nothing, than of the Writings by which they enjoy their Eſtates; and there is no great dauger, when a will is once come to the hands of the right Heir, that it will be loſt or ſalſified, to his prejudice: but if the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> were altered, it muſt be upon the account of ſome advantage to ſuch as muſt be ſuppoſed to make the Alterations; and conſequently to the diſadvantage of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who therefore would have found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves concerned to oppoſe ſuch Alterations. But as the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> were in the nature of a Deed of Settlement, to every Tribe and Family; ſo they were a Law too, which all were obliged to know and obſerve, under the ſevereſt Penalties: And being ſo generally known, and univerſally practiſed, it could no more be falſified at any time ſince its firſt Promulgation, than it could be now at this day. For,</p>

                        <p n="2">2. Another thing which made the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> leſs capable of being impoſed upon in this matter, was, That they were by their Laws themſelves obliged to the conſtant ſtudy of them; they were to teach them their Children, and to be continually diſcourſing and meditating on them; to <hi>bind them for a ſign upon their hand, that they might be as front<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets between their eyes;</hi> to <hi>teach them their children, ſpeaking of them when they ſate in their houſes, and when they walked by the way, when they lay down, and when they roſe up;</hi> to <hi>write them upon the door-poſts of their houſes and upon their gates,</hi> Deut. xi. 18, 19, 20. Nothing was to be more notorious and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to them, and accordingly they were perfectly acquainted with them, and (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays) knew them as well as they did their own Names, they had them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in their mouths, and thouſands have died in defence of them, and could by no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces or Torments be brought to forſake or renounce them. And to this end, One Day in Seven was by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s his Law ſet apart for the learning and underſtanding of it.

                        <p>And then at the end of every Seven Years the Law was read in the moſt publick and ſolemn manner in the Solemnity of the <hi>Year of Releaſe,</hi> in the <hi>Feaſt of Tabernacles.

Gather the people together, Men, and woman, and children, and thy ſtranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the Lord your God, and obſerve to do all the words of this law: And that their children which have not known any thing, may hear and learn to fear, the Lord your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to poſſeſs it,</hi> Deut. xxxi. 10, 11, 12, 13. How is it poſſible that any more effectual care could have been taken to ſecure a Law from being depraved and altered by Impoſtures? Every ſeventh Day, at leaſt, was
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:61773:146"/>ſet apart for the reading and learning it, in their ſeveval Tribes, throughout all the Land; and then once in ſeven years it was read at a publick and ſolemn Feaſt, when they were all obliged to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And for this purpoſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> wrot a Book of the Law: which was put in the ſide of the Ark, that it might be there for a Teſtimony againſt them, if they ſhould trangreſs it, much more, if they ſhould make any Alterations in it, And out of this Book the King was to write him a Copy of the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> xvii. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For after all that the wicked and idolatrous Kings could do to ſuppreſs the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and draw aſide the People to Idolatry, the Authentick Book of the Law, writen by <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, was ſtill preſerved in <hi>Joſiah</hi>'s time, beſides the ſeveral Copies which muſt be diſperſed throughout the Land, for the uſe of their Synagogues, and thoſe which muſt be remaining in the hands of the Prophets, and other pious Men. And there is little reaſon to doubt, but that this very Book written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> was preſerved during the Captivity, and was that Book which <hi>Ezra</hi> read to the People. It is by no means credible, that the Prophets would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that Book to be loſt, much leſs that they would ſuffer all the Copies generally to be loſt or corrupted; which indeed, conſidering
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61773:146"/>the number, was hardly poſſible. Is it proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> would uſe that favour which he had with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to any other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, rather than for the preſervation of the Book of the Law?

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61773:147"/>is called <hi>a Scribe of the law of the God of heaven,</hi> Ezra vii. 6, 11, 12. By which it appears that there were Scribes of the Law during the Captivity, who were known by this ſolemn Stile and Character, and whoſe care and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment it was to ſtudy and write over the Law, of whom <hi>Ezra</hi> was the principal at the time of their Return. It is moſt probable then, that the Book of the Law was preſerved in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s own Hand, till the coming of the <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Babylon;</hi> beſides the Copies that were preſerved in the hands of <hi>Daniel, Nehemiah, Ezra, Zechariah,</hi> and the other Prophets, who were not only of unqueſtionable Integrity, but wrote themſelves by Divine Inſpiration.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Nothing is more expreſsly forbidden in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> than all Fraud and Deceit; and it cannot reaſonably be ſuſpected that any Man would be guilty of a Fraud of the higheſt nature imaginable, to introduce or eſtabliſh a Law that forbids it. <hi>Moſes</hi> had forewarned them againſt all ſuch practices, both in his Laws in general, and by an expreſs Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Ye ſhall not add unto the word which I command you, neither ſhall ye diminiſh ought from it,</hi> Deut. iv. 2. And all who had any regard to the Obſervation of his Laws, would obſerve this, as well as other parts of it; for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Authority of all the reſt inviolable: And if they had had no regard to the Law, but had altered it as they pleaſed, they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have made ſuch Alterations as would
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:61773:147"/>have gratified the People, and would have taken great care to leave nothing which might give offence; but the Laws of <hi>Moſes</hi> are ſuch, as that without a Divine Authority to enforce them, they would never have been complied with, but would have been grievous to a leſs ſuſpicious and impatient People than the <hi>Jews</hi> were. If it be ſaid, That the Prohibition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Alterations might be added amongſt other things; there is no ground of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for it, but ſo much odds againſt it, that a Man might as well ſuſpect that the whole Five Books had been forged, as to pitch upon that particular Verſe, and ſay that it is not genuine. Beſides, why ſhould Impoſtors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert ſuch a Clauſe as would hinder them from changing any thing in the Law ever after? why ſhould they not rather reſerve to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a liberty of changing and adding as often as they thought fit?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As the Laws themſelves could not be invented nor altered, after <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time; ſo neither could the Account of the Miracles wrought by him, be inſerted after his death, by any particular Man, nor by any Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Combination of Men whatſoever. For if the Miracles, by which the Law is ſuppoſed to be confirmed, were afterwards inſerted, they muſt be intended as a Sanction, to give Authority to it, and keep the People in awe, when they were become uneaſie and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient under the Government of thoſe Laws.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:61773:148"/>But it muſt needs be much more difficult to introduce Laws at firſt, than to govern a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by them, after they have been once intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and are ſetled and received amongſt them. Indeed, it is incredible, how Laws, ſo little favourable to the eaſe or advantage of a People which were ſo expenſive and burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in there Ceremonies, and which where purpoſely deſigned, in many things, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Cuſtoms of all the Nations round about them, and to the Cuſtoms which they had been themſelves acquainted with in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> in ſo many Inſtances, could be at firſt introduced, but by Miracles: but if they could have been once introduced without Miracles there is no reaſon to think, but that when the People were uſed and accuſtom'd to them, there would have been no need of any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Miracles, to keep them in obedience to them; and as little reaſon there is to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that they would have been over awed by a Report of Miracles, which muſt be ſuppoſed never to have been heard of, till the People gave occaſion for the Invention of them, by their Diſobedience.</p>
                        <p>The Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> were read (as I have ſhewn) in the Synagogues, or Religious Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, in the ſeveral Tribes, at leaſt every <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> and were appointed to be ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read, in the audience of all the People, at the <hi>Feaſt of Tabernacles,</hi> every Seven Years: and if they had had no knowledge of the Laws
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:61773:148"/>of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but from the Rehearſal of it at the <hi>Feaſt of Tabernacles;</hi> yet can we conceive that the Body of the Jewiſh Nation ſhould be ſo ſtupid and forgetful, as not to remember when theſe Miracles muſt be ſuppoſed to be firſt read to them, that they had never heard them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But how impoſſible is it, that they ſhould be thus impoſed upon, when they heard the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> read every Week to them, and had them beſides in their own keeping to read them at their leiſure? The Miracles now make up great part of the Books of <hi>Moſes;</hi> they are every where interſperſed and intermix'd, throughout the Hiſtory; and they are of ſuch a nature, as is moſt apt to make impreſſion upon the Memories of Men: And can we imagine, that Miracles, ſo often repeated, and every were inculcated, could be inſerted by any contrivance, and impoſed upon a People who were all wont to hear the Law publickly read in a ſolemn Aſſembly once every Seven Years and heard it read in their Synagogues beſides every Seventh Day; Would they not be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſurpriſed, the firſt time they heard the Relation of the Plagues inflicted on the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> of the Judgment upon <hi>Korah</hi> and his Company, and of the miraculous Puniſhments which befell the Idolatrous and Diſobedient in the Wilderneſs; Would they not ſoon have found out ſo obvious a Deceit as this muſt have been, if it had been one; If we can think that ſuch Inſertions could paſs without diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:61773:149"/>why may we not as well believe too, that as many more might be made now, and not be diſcovered? Would not the whole Body of the People have been able to teſtifie that all this was counterfeited, and inſerted into the Law; for no ſuch thing was read to them in their Synagogues upon the <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> nor had been read at the end of the laſt Seven Years, but it was all now added to terrifie them and keep them from following the Cuſtoms of other Nations; Would not this have been the worſt contrivance that could have been thought of, to keep a People in awe, to tell them of ſuch things as every Man of them could diſprove, that was of Age, and had but Underſtanding and Memory enough to know what he had heard ſo often read before, and to diſtinguiſh it from ſuch things as are ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that they could hardly eſcape any one's Memory, who had ever heard of them.</p>
                        <p>They had Books of the Law for their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate reading; and beſides the reading of it in their Weekly Aſſemblies, they had a ſolemn Publication and Proclamation of their Law once every Seven Years, as it were purpoſely to prevent any Deſign of falſifying it: And to have read any thing ſo remarkable, as the Miracles of <hi>Moſes</hi> are, in all their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſo often repeated and inſiſted upon, if the People had not found them in their own Books, and had not been uſed to hear them read to them, from the time of the giving the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:61773:149"/>Law by <hi>Moſes,</hi> had been only for the Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors to proclaim themſelves Impoſtors, but could never have deceived any Man.</p>
                        <p>And beſides the care that was taken for the Preſervation of the Books of the Law, there were publick Memorials of the principal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles enjoined; ſuch was the <hi>Feaſt of the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</hi> in remembrance of the Angel's paſſing over the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when he ſlew the firſt-born born of the <hi>Aegyptians;</hi> and the <hi>Feaſt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles,</hi> in remembrance of their dwelling in Tents in the Wilderneſs; and ſuch were the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> the <hi>Ark,</hi> and the <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle:</hi> Theſe were things ſeen and obſerved, or known by all; and they could not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced after <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, becauſe there could be no pretence for it; ſince they who introduced them, muſt ſuppoſe them to have been before, at the very time when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned firſt to introduce them. The <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim</hi> was both a conſtant Miracle, and a conſtant Atteſtation to the Law, by which it was ordained. And it appears, that the Prieſts who were to examine and judge of Leproſie either in Perſons or Things, were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from the Infection of it, though it were infectious to all others: And their conſtant Service could not be performed without a
<note n="(t)" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Lightfoot's Proſpect of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> c. 34. p. 2030.</note> miraculous Diſpenſation.</p>
                        <p>Thus it is evident, That there is all the Proof which it is poſſible to bring in any caſe of this nature, that the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> could
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61773:150"/>not be falſified by any Man, or Party of Men whatſoever; ſince the Nature and Inſtitution of the Law it ſelf did effectually provide againſt all Impoſtures; and the <hi>Jews</hi> had all the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that it is poſſible for any People to have, that the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> are the ſame which he wrote and left behind him. And this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired them with ſuch a zeal for their Law, as to ſacrifice their Lives in vindication of it; whereas there was no Book whatſoever, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> obſerves, amongſt the <hi>Heathens,</hi> which any Man amongſt them would not rather a thouſand times ſee deſtroyed, though it were in never ſo much eſteem with them, than he would ſuffer for it: Which ſhews that the <hi>Jews</hi> were fully convinced of the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their Law, from all the Evidence above-mentioned: and were perſuaded, that it is the ſame which <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered, and left behind him.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The <hi>Pentateuch</hi> could not be invented nor falſified by the joint Conſent of the whole Nation, either in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, or after it. For how is it poſſible that ſuch a thing ſhould have been concealed from all other Nations? and, that a whole Nation ſhould know of the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and no Man ever diſcover it, nor no Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate ever divulge it, but they and their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould always profeſs, that they believed the Law to be revealed to <hi>Moſes</hi> by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, juſt as we now have it in the <hi>Peutateuch;</hi> that under all Afflictions and Adverſities, they
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61773:150"/>ſhould impute their Sufferings to the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law; and that ſo many ſhould die, rather than depart from it;</p>
                        <p>Upon the Revolt of the Ten Tribes, <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> would certainly have diſcover'd it, if he had but ſuſpected any ſuch thing as an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, or could but have hoped to make the People believe that the Laws of <hi>Moſes</hi> were not of Divine Inſtitution, but of Humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and Contrivance, but he ſuppoſed the Truth of its Divine Original, whilſt he temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the People to the tranſgreſſion of it; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy Gods, O Iſrael, which brought thee up out of the land of Aegypt,</hi> 1 King. xii. 28. he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes them brought out of the land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and brought out by a Divine Power; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to perſuade them, that the two <hi>Calves</hi> which he had ſet up in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> were the Gods who delivered them, and by whoſe Authority the Law was given them; and that therefore either of thoſe Places was as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſacrifice in, as <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever abſurd it were, yet he did not think ſo abſurd, as to endeavour to make them believe that their Law it ſelf was no better than an Impoſture: he had ſome hopes to ſucceed in this Project; and the Event ſhews, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Temper and Principles of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he had to deal with; but the other was too groſs for him to attempt. The true Prophets of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ever as zealous for the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as the Prophets of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the Falſe
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61773:151"/>Pophets of either Kingdom, never durſt deny its Authority: theſe Falſe prophets affronted and contradicted the Prophets of the Lord, but they ever owned the Law, and pretended to ſpeak in the Name of that God who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd it to <hi>Moſes.</hi> And this Diviſion of the Ten Tribes made it impoſſible afterwards for either the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or of <hi>Judah,</hi> to make any Alterations in the Books of <hi>Moſes;</hi> becauſe there was ſo great emulation and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities betwixt the two Kingdoms, that they could never have agreed to inſert the ſame Corruptions; and if either of them had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted ſuch a thing, it would ſoon have been diſcovered by the other; and therefore the agreement of the <hi>Samaritan</hi> with the <hi>Hebrew Pentateuch,</hi> is a plain argument that they are but different Copies of the ſame Book, and that it is undoubtedly genuine. The <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> notwithſtanding their great prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Idolatry, never caſt off the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as they would certainly have done, being ſo often brought into bondage by their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Nations, if they had not been well aſſured of the Authority of that Law which they tranſgreſs'd; but they were reduced to the Obedience of the Law, by the Oppreſſions of Iolatrous Nations; they hoped for Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance upon their Repentance, according to the Promiſes made in it, and could by no Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Torments be perſuaded or forced to renounce it: But the long Captivity in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>
                           <pb n="209" facs="tcp:61773:151"/>wrought a perfect cure in the <hi>Jews,</hi> as to their inclination to idolatry; which could never have been, unleſs by their own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, in ſeeing the Prophecies fulfilled, and by other Arguments, they had been ſully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Truth of their own Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all others.</p>
                        <p>If it had been of their own invention, the People would have made their Law, in every reſpect, more favourable to themſelves; they would not have cloyed it with burthen ſome Ceremonies, to diſtinguiſh themſelves from the neighbour-Nations, whoſe Idolatries they were ſo long prone to, and which theſe C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Miracles which I have mention'd, were moſt of them Judgments upon the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> for their Diſobedience, and they would never have ſet down theſe Miracles, but would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have leſt them out, though they were
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61773:152"/>true, as diſgraceful to their Nation. For thus <hi>Joſephus</hi> has omitted ſome things to avoid the Scandal, which he was a ware, would have been given to the <hi>Heathen,</hi> by a full and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Relation of the whole Hiſtory of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as it is deſcribed in the Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And they could be as little ignorant as <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> what would prove diſgraceful to them, and what would make for their Honour and Renown; and when the deſign of theſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Forgeries and Falſifications muſt have been to advance the Glory of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they would never have made ſuch as theſe. No, if they had made any Alterations, it would have been, to ſtrike out thoſe nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Paſſages which are ſo reproachful to their Nation, and to have inſerted others, which might raiſe the Fame and Glory of Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and of their Anceſtors; and to have changed thoſe Ceremonies that were ſo bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome and ſo ſingular, for thoſe which would have been more eaſie to themſelves, and might have recommended them to the good opinion and eſteem of the neighbour Nations. But when ſo refractary a People became ſo zealous for ſuch a Law, ſo uneaſie at firſt, and ſo diſtaſtful to them; it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable argument, that they had the greateſt Aſſurance of its Divine Original, and that they would neither falſifie it themſelves, nor ſufter others to falſifie it.</p>

                        <p>The People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to be unanimous to a Man, in the making theſe Laws, if they were of their own making; for if any one had diſſented, he could not fail of Arguments to draw others after him. In making Laws, the Intereſts and Conveniencies of the Law-makers are always the Motives for the enacting them; and beſides the Publick Honour and Welfare of the Nation, which too often are leſs conſidered, the particular Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of every ſingle Man would have made him concerned to put a ſtop to ſuch Laws. No People can be ſuppoſed to conſent to the making Laws, by which they are forbidden to ſow their Land every Seventh Year, and are commanded to leave their Habitations, and go up to the capital City, from every part of their Country, thrice in a Year: no Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could agree to enact ſuch Laws of their own contrivance; becauſe none could ſubſiſt in the obſervation of them, without a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. How can we conceive it poſſible for any People to ſubſiſt by ſuch Laws, if they had been of their own making? or, that any Nation ſhould agree in the enacting ſuch Laws as muſt provoke all their neighbour Nations to make War againſt them? nay, by which they actually declared an irreconcileable War againſt ſeven Nations at once? For one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to diſtinguiſh themſelves, by their Laws and Conſtitutions, from all other People; to lay the very Foundations of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61773:153"/>in the diſgrace and infamy of all their neighbour Nations; to report, that after ſo many loathſome and grievous Plagues, inflicted upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his People, they came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and at laſt, by the deſtruction of him and his whole Army in the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> made their eſcape, and that they forced their way thro' all the other Nations that withſtood their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and vanquiſhed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them as they went; and then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim a ſacred War againſt all the Nations whoſe Land they were to poſſeſs, and many of whoſe Poſterity were remaining in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time, and probably long after, and might have been able to confute great part of what the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> affirmed of themſelves, if it had been falſe, and of a late invention: for any People, I ſay, to invent ſuch Accounts of Themſelves and their Anceſtors, and then to make ſuch Laws, and to have the one believed, and the other obeyed, is altogether incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: When they had enraged all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations to their deſtruction, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged themſelves, by their Laws, to leave all their Borders naked, thrice every year, and to give them an opportunity to deſtroy them; and no People could have lived half an Age, in ſuch a condition, under ſuch Laws, unleſs they had been protected by God himſelf, the Author of them.</p>
                        <p>It appears therefore, that as neither <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, nor any Party of Men either in his
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61773:153"/>time, or after it, could either invent, or change and falſified the Books which are under his Name; ſo it is ſtill more extravagant (if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) to conceit, that the whole People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould either in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, or after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be conſcious to ſuch an Impoſture; and yet that no man ſhould ever diſcover it, but it ſhould to this day be concealed from all other Nations: and that neither at the time of the Diviſion of the Ten Tribes, when <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> was forced to ſet up Altars in other Places, to keep the People from going up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to worſhip, nor upon any other occaſion, this Secret, if that may be called ſo, which muſt be known to ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, ſhould ever come to light. Beſides that, they could never have invented thoſe Laws, by unanimous conſent amongſt themſelves, which they were ſo hardly brought to obey; and if they had not been diſobedient, they would never have pretended they were, and have invented Miracles to make it believed; and if they had been never ſo forward in their obedience, they could not have lived in the obſervation of the Law, without a perpetual Miracle.</p>
                        <p>If then the Miracles of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Divine Authority by which he gave his Law to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> be ſufficiently atteſted, ſuppoſing the Matters of Fact to be true, which are contained in the <hi>Pentateuch;</hi> and if neither <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf could feign the

The People being all gone over, and every thing performed which God had commanded, the Prieſts with the Ark came out of the channel of the River, where they had all this while ſtood, and as ſoon as their feet <hi>were lift up unto the dry land,</hi> beyond the Waters which ſtood then on an heap, and did not flow down as at other times, they reſumed their courſe, and <hi>returned to their place, and flowed over all the banks as they did before,</hi> Joſh. iv. 8.

                        <p>After the Death of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> God raiſed up <hi>Judges</hi> out of ſeveral Families and Tribes, with an immediate and extraordintry Commiſſion to govern and protect his People: ſo that there could be no private Ends, or politick Deſigns carry'd on, under the pretence of a Divine Commiſſion. But upon their Diſobedience and Idolatries, they were, from time to time, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Slaughter and Captivity; and, upon their Repentance were, as conſtantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered; Judges being purpoſely raiſed up to be Conquerors and Deliverers, and never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſucceſs.</p>

He reſigned the Government, though he had the Power in his hands to appoint two Kings ſucceſſively, and by Gods Commandment raiſed both <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> out of their obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to a Throne. <hi>Samuel</hi> ſays plainly, That when the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came to him to ask a King, <hi>the thing diſpleaſed him,</hi> 1 Sam. viii. 6. and he who could make Two Kings of Two different Tribes, and of no Intereſt in their reſpective Tribes, might as well have made himſelf King, if he had acted upon Humane Conſiderations, and by Humane Power and Means. The Divine Power therefore was viſible in the Government of the <hi>Children of Iſrael,</hi> from the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> to <hi>Saul;</hi> for they were conſtantly governed by Perſons of God's appointment; their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was a Theocracy, being adminiſtred by God's immediate Direction, <hi>the Lord their God was their King,</hi> 1 Sam. xii. 12.</p>

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61773:162"/>by God, with an extraordinary Commiſſion, to declare his Will; and they were not confined to the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> or to any one particular Tribe, but ſometimes taken out of one Tribe, and ſometimes out of another: for tho' the <hi>Jews</hi> had Colleges and Schools to prepare and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie Men, by a vertuous and religious Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for Divine Illuminations; yet divers others, who had not been educated in this manner, were endued with the Spirit of Prophecy; and ſome of them were but of very mean Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and others again of Royal Blood.</p>
                        <p>They reproved both their Kings and their Prieſts with a fearleſs and undaunted Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Authority: and this Plain-dealing, ſuch as became Men who ſpake and acted by a Divine Impulſe, without Deſign, and without any Diſguiſe, ſometimes commanded great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence towards them from Princes, not eaſie to be well adviſed or directed. <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> a willful and raſh Prince, at the head of an Army of an Hundred and fourſcore thouſand choſen Men, upon the Word of the Lord, deliver'd to him by <hi>Shemaiah,</hi> return'd home without attempting any thing, to regain the Tribes that had revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him to <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> xii. 21. <hi>Ahab,</hi> though an exceeding wicked King, after a ſignal Victory, bore the reproof of a Prophet, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a Judgment upon Him and his People for letting <hi>Ben-hadad</hi> go, and was much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at it, 1 <hi>King.</hi> xx. 42, 43. and the ſame <hi>Ahab</hi> rent his Cloaths, and put on Sackcloth,

                        <p>It is certain, that the Books of the Law, and the Writings of the ancient Prophets, were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preſerved, during the Captivity, and are
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:61773:164"/>frequently referr'd to, and cited by the latter Prophets: The <hi>Pentateuch</hi> has been already ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of; and this is as evident of the Books of the Prophets. The Prophecy of <hi>Micah</hi> is quoted, <hi>Jer.</hi> xxvi. 18. a little before the Captivity; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, the Prophecy of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> is cited, <hi>Dan.</hi> ix. 2. and all the Prophets, <hi>v.</hi> 6. and ſo the Prophets in general are mention'd, <hi>Neh.</hi> ix. 26, 30. And <hi>Zechariah</hi> not only cites the <hi>former Prophets, Zech.</hi> i. 4. but ſuppoſes their Writings well known to the People: <hi>Should you not hear the words which the Lord hath cried by the former prophets, when Jeruſalem was inhabited, and in proſperity?</hi> chap. vii. 7. The Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> is likewiſe cited, <hi>Tob.</hi> ii. 6. and <hi>Jonas,</hi> and the Prophets in general, <hi>chap.</hi> xiv. 4, 5, 8. There can then be no reaſon to queſtion, but that <hi>Ezra, Nehemiah, Daniel, Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah,</hi> and the other Prophets in the time of the Captivity, were very careful to keep the Books of the former Prophets; for they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cite them, and appeal to them; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Deliverance out of their Captivity, by the accompliſhment of them. And perhaps, from the Originals themſelves, or however, from Copies taken by <hi>Ezra</hi> the Scribe, or by ſome of the latter Prophets, or at leaſt acknowledged for genuine, and approved of by them, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Prophecies, and other Inſpired Writings, were preſerved; and thoſe of the latter Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were added to them; and all together, make up <hi>the Book of the Prophets,</hi> mention'd, <hi>Act.</hi> vii. 42. which was read, as well as the Law,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:61773:164"/>every <hi>Sabbath-day, Act.</hi> xiii. 27. The Books of <hi>Joſhua, Judges, Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Kings,</hi> have the Title of the <hi>former Prophets,</hi> in the Hebrew Bibles, to diſtinguiſh them from the Books which they ſet out under the Title of the <hi>latter Prophets, Iſaiah, Jeremiah,</hi> &amp;c. The Books of <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> have been already ſpoken of. The Books of <hi>Samuel,</hi> were written by <hi>Samuel, Nathan,</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxix. 29. from whence we may conclude that the firſt Book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> to the 25th. Chapter, was written by <hi>Samuel</hi> himſelf; and the reſt of that, and the whole Second Book, by <hi>Nathan</hi> and <hi>Gad:</hi> but <hi>Samuel</hi> being a Perſon ſo much concerned in the former part of the Hiſtory, and having written ſo much of it, out of reſpect to him the whole Two Books go under his Name: though, indeed, the <hi>Jews</hi> anciently reckon'd both the Books of <hi>Samuel</hi> as one Book; and <hi>Aquila</hi> (as <hi>Theodorit</hi> has obſerved) made no diſtinction between the Firſt and Second Books of <hi>Samuel,</hi> following the Hebrew Copies of his time: and in our Hebrew Bibles, though they are diſtinguiſhed, yet they are not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in the ſame manner as the two Books of <hi>Kings</hi> and of <hi>Chronicles</hi> are: and it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that a Book begun by <hi>Samuel,</hi> and continued by other Prophets, ſhould bear the Name only of <hi>Samuel.</hi> From 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxix. 29. we may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe learn, that the beginning of the Firſt Book of <hi>Kings</hi> muſt be written by one of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Both the Books of <hi>Kings,</hi> as far as <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>'s Reign, were written before <hi>Joſiah</hi>'s time;
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61773:165"/>for, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.5. it is ſaid of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> That <hi>he truſted in the Lord God of Iſrael: ſo that after him was none like him of all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him:</hi> And of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> it is ſaid, 2 <hi>King.</hi> xxiii. 25. That <hi>like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the Lord with all his heart,</hi> &amp;c. For it is evident, that <hi>Joſiah,</hi> in his Reformation, exceeded <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> and from hence it appears, that the Hiſtory of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> muſt be written before <hi>Joſiah</hi>'s time; or elſe it could not have been with truth, ſaid of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> That there was no King after him who was like him, or equalled him, of all the Kings of <hi>Judah.</hi> From 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> iv. 43. it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that it was written before the Captivity; though the Genealogies were tranſcribed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards out of the Records, as we learn from 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> ix. 1. That the Second Book of <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,</hi> as well as the Firſt Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> was written before the Captivity we may conclude from 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> v. 9. 1 <hi>King.</hi> viii. 8. for the Ark was not remaining after the Captivity. The laſt Chapter of the Second Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> gives ſo particular an account of the manner of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying them away Captive in every material circumſtance, that it ſeems to have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at that very time; and is an argument, that Memorirs were conſtantly taken and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of all that happened. The Second Book of <hi>Chronicles</hi> concludes with the Firſt Year of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in the ſame words with which the Book of <hi>Ezra</hi> begins, being added by him at the time
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:61773:165"/>when <hi>Cyrus</hi> gave out his Proclamation: for the Prophets, from time to time, made Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Hiſtories of their Predeceſſors, by inſerting what related to their own Times; and it was no unuſual thing, among the Ancients, (as <hi>Grotius</hi> obſerves) to begin one Book with the Concluſion of another.</p>
                        <p>The Pſalms are quoted under the Title of the <hi>Prophets, Mat.</hi> xiii. 35, &amp; xxvii. 35. and from the firſt penning, they were uſed in the Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xvi. 7. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> v. 13. &amp; vii. 6. &amp; xx. 21. <hi>Jer.</hi> xxxiii. 11. <hi>Ezra</hi> iii. 10, 11. This was known, even to their Enemies, in their Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> cxxxvii. 3. and ſome of them were written by the Prophets under it. And Leſſons out of the Law and the Prophets, with Hymns out of the Pſalms, and Prayers, made up the Jewiſh Form of Worſhip. <hi>Moſes and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> are put for the whole Old Teſtament, <hi>Luke</hi> xvi. 29. <hi>Acts</hi> xiii. 15.</p>
                        <p>And if <hi>both the Law and the Prophets,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending all the Books of Scripture written before the Captivity, were ſtill extant, and well known, and made uſe of by Pious Men, during all that time, and the People had Copies of them, or had means and opportunities of being acquainted with them, as the Prophet <hi>Zecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah</hi> ſuppoſes, <hi>Zech.</hi> vii. 7. there is no reaſon to imagine, that they had not ſufficient knowledge of the Hebrew Tongue at their Reſtoration, many being ſtill alive, who were firſt carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Captive: and the Writings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:61773:166"/>during the Captivity, ſhew that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did underſtand it; for they all wrote in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, except upon ſome particular occaſions, where their Prophecies more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately concerned the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Affairs. Both Men and Women could underſtand <hi>Ezra,</hi> when he read the Law; <hi>And the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law,</hi> Neh. viii. 3. And it was not the Language, unleſs in ſome Particulars, which in all Languages will want explication to the Vulgar, who are Natives, but the Sence and Meaning, that was interpreted, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8. And in the ſame manner, the Letter of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was both <hi>written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue,</hi> Ezra iv. 7. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> particularly complains, that the Children of thoſe who had married ſtrange Wives, <hi>could not ſpeak in the Jews lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage?</hi> which ſuppoſes that the Children of other Parents, as well as the Parents themſelves, were taught to ſpeak the Hebrew Tongue, <hi>Neh.</hi> xiii. 24. And the Decree of <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> in favour of the <hi>Jews,</hi> was written <hi>unto every province, according unto the writing thereof; and unto every people, after their language; and unto the Jews, according to their writing, and according to their language,</hi> Eſt. viii. 9. which ſeems to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtill retained not only their Language, but their manner of Writing it, or the form and faſhion of their Letters, under the Captivity.</p>
                        <pb n="235" facs="tcp:61773:166"/>
                        <p>Not long after the Captivity, the Scriptures were tranſlated into the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue; and were diſperſed into ſo many hands, among the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> that the Copies could not be deſtroyed, either in the time of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> or at any other time, by the malice of Perſcutors, or any other accident. And though the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo fond of their Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as to <hi>make the Word of God of none effect</hi> by them; yet they never added any Books to the Canon of Scripture, in favour of thoſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which they were ſo zealous for; but when they had no longer any Prophets among them, they durſt not place any other Books in the ſame Rank and Authority with thoſe which the Prophets had left behind them. All the Canonical Books were written by Inſpired Authors, and have been in conſtant uſe among the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in their private Houſes, and publick Aſſemblies, even from the firſt writing them; for they were preſerved during the Captivity, and both underſtood and uſed by the People: but their other Books, written under the Second Temple, though never ſo uſeful and pious, were never received with the like eſteem and veneration; they pretended to no more than Humane Compoſition, and were never ranked with thoſe of Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>

And in the Hiſtorical Books of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> in which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies and Miracles of the Prophets are rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, reference is frequently made to the Records then extant in the <hi>Chronicles</hi> of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael;</hi> moſt of the Prophecies and Miracles being of that Publick Nature, and ſo intermix'd with the Affairs of State, that they muſt be recorded together with them.</p>

                              <hi>Joſeph.

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61773:167"/>the Prophet, and which, by the Prophet's Prayer, was reſtored again whole to him, as it was before; the other Miracle was wrought upon the Altar, by rending it, and pouring out the Aſhes from it. And a Prophecy delivered in the preſence and to the face of an enraged Prince, againſt the Religion of his own ſetting up, to ſecure to himſelf the Kingdom he ſo lately became poſſeſſed of, at the very time when he was offering Incenſe upon his New Altar: And this Prophecy, confirmed by an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Judgment both upon the King himſelf, and his Altar, in the ſight of ſo numerous an Appearance as muſt be preſent on ſo ſolemn an occaſion, and theſe Enemies to the Prophet, who came from <hi>Judah,</hi> and to his Religion; a Prophecy thus delivered, had all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to make it remarkable and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, in all the Tribes both of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> then at hoſtility with each other, that can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt be conceived: And yet the ſtrange Death of the Prophet of <hi>Judah,</hi> for tranſgreſſing, by his own confeſſion, the Word of the Lord to him, and his Sepulchre, with its Title or <hi>Inſcription</hi> ſtill remaining at <hi>Bethel,</hi> when <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> demoliſhed the Altar there, gave a further confirmation to it.</p>
                        <p>The fulfilling of this Prophecy by <hi>Joſiah,</hi> was no leſs remarkable, 2 <hi>King.</hi> xxiii. 15. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> was the Son of a very wicked King, and born at a time when the People were exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupted by the Idolatry of his Grandfather
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:61773:168"/>
                           <hi>Manaſſes;</hi> and his Sons likewiſe proved wicked: ſo that he was ſo ſingular in his Piety, and ſo wonderful an Example of it, that no Man of his own Age could have imagin'd that of him, which had been fo retold ſo many hundred years ago. In all humane appearance, this was a very unlikely time to ſee that Prophecy fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and that which had been wonderful in any Age, was much more wonderful in this: and in ſo wicked an Age, this good King ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Work of Reformation very young, to ſhew that it was not of Men, but of God.</p>
                        <p>The Deliverance of <hi>Judah,</hi> at <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi>'s Prayer, was foretold by <hi>Jahaziel</hi> in the midſt of the Congregation; and was accompliſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, by their Enemies deſtroying one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xx.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Elijah</hi> foretold, that the Dogs ſhould lick <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Blood in <hi>Jezreel,</hi> where they had licked the Blood of <hi>Naboth:</hi> which, as

                           <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays, was objected by <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> one of the Falſe Prophets, againſt <hi>Micaiah,</hi> who foretold that <hi>Ahab</hi> ſhould be ſlain at <hi>Ramoth-gilead;</hi> but he was brought home in his Chariot from <hi>Ramoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilead</hi> to <hi>Samaria,</hi> and there the Dogs licked his Blood in <hi>Jezreel,</hi> 1 <hi>King,</hi> xxii. 38. ſo that both the Prophecy of <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Michaiah</hi> was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. And when one Prophet ſeems contrary to another, one foretelling the principal thing, and another ſome accidental circumſtance, which thoſe that were preſent, and moſt concerned in the Action, could not imagine, till it happened:
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:61773:168"/>and Falſe Prophets, in the mean time, watch the Events, to take all Advantages from it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the True Prophets, and can find none: nothing more can be deſired, to aſſure us of the Truth of any Prophecy. The ſame Prophet foretold the like Judgment upon <hi>Jezabel,</hi> and that the Houſe of <hi>Ahab</hi> ſhould be like the Houſe of <hi>Jereboam,</hi> and like the Houſe of <hi>Baaſha;</hi> the Deſtruction of both which had been foretold by other Prophets, and their Prophecies fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as this of <hi>Elijah</hi>'s alſo was.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Elijah,</hi> by a Writing ſent to <hi>Jehoram</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> foretold his Death, and the ſtrange manner of it, <hi>viz.</hi> That after the loſs of his Children, and his Wives, and all his Goods, he ſhould be afflicted in his Bowels, and that his Bowels ſhould fall out by degrees, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxi. 12. The ſame Prophet not only foretold the Death of <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> but cauſed Fire twice to come down from Heaven, upon thoſe who were ſent to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> i. And at his Prayer, Fire deſcended from Heaven, and conſumed the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, in the ſight of <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prophets, being Four hundred and fifty; to whom <hi>Elijah,</hi> who was the only Prophet of the Lord there preſent, had made this Propoſal, <hi>The God that anſwereth by fire, let him be God:</hi> And when <hi>Baal,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their hideous Cries, and the cutting themſelves, did not hear them; then, upon <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Prayer, <hi>the fire of the Lord fell, and conſumed the burnt ſacrifice, and the wood and the ſtones, and the duſt, and licked up the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:61773:169"/>water that was in the trench,</hi> 1 King. xviii. 38. which was the ſame Miracle, repeated in the midſt of Idolaters who were ſo enraged and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked againſt the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> that had been before wrought in the ſight of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the time of <hi>Moſes, Lev.</hi> ix. 24. and of <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxi. 26. and at the Dedication of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> vii. 1.

                        <p>The miraculous Cure of <hi>Naaman</hi>'s Leproſie, muſt be notorious throughout the Kingdoms both of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> v. The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Deliverance of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when the <hi>Syrians</hi> heard a noiſe of Horſes and Chariots, and therefore raiſed the Siege of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and the Plenty which followed, was foretold by <hi>Eliſha,</hi> with a Judgment upon that Lord, who doubted of the Truth of his Prediction. The ſame Prophet foretold the Death of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadad</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> and that he ſhould neither recover of his Sickneſs, nor die a Natural Death. And the Reign of <hi>Hazael,</hi> who ſucceeded him, is deſcrib'd in ſuch true and dreadful Characters, that <hi>Hazael</hi> thought it impoſſible for him to be guilty of ſo much cruelty, 2 <hi>King.</hi> vii, viii.</p>
                        <p>The Leproſie inflicted upon <hi>

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:61773:169"/>till his death; and for that reaſon, he lived ſeparately, and his Son, from that time, had the adminiſtration of Affairs, 2 <hi>King.</hi> xv. 5. and this Miracle of the Leproſie was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a terrible Earthquake, mention'd <hi>Zech.</hi> xiv. 5. <hi>Amos</hi> i. 1. and the

Jeremiah,</hi> That he ſhould die in peace, and be buried after the manner of his Anceſtors: <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> That he ſhould die at <hi>Babylon,</hi> and if we compare all this with the Hiſtory, nothing ever was more punctually fulfilled: For <hi>Zedekiah</hi> ſaw the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who commanded his Eyes to be put out, before he was brought to <hi>Babylon;</hi> and he died there, but died pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably, and was ſuffered to have the uſual Funeral Solemnities, 2 <hi>King.</hi> xxv. 6, 7.

                        <p>The prophets did their Miracles in the moſt publick manner; and their Prophecies were delivered not in corners, but openly, before all the People; not in obſcure and ambiguous Words, but in plain Terms, with a particular Account of Perſons, and Time, and Place: they were kept, they were read and ſtudied by that very People who at firſt as little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded them, as any Man now amongſt us can do, but ſlew the prophets themſelves,

                        </head>
                        <p>IT is a thing altogether incredible, that the Inhabitants of ſo ſmall a part of the World as <hi>Judaea</hi> is, ſhould lay a Deſign of impoſing upon the reſt of Mankind, which could prove ſo ſucceſsful for ſo many thouſand Years together; and that they ſhould be ſuch Maſters of Deceit, and the World ſo fond of receiving Revelations from them, that at laſt, though the greateſt part of that People diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the Books which ſome few, and thoſe the moſt unlearned among them, would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for Inſpired Writings; yet the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of theſe Books ſhould be more acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in all Parts of the World, than thoſe had ever been, in which they all unanimouſly agreed, and the reſt ſhould be received for the ſake of theſe, more than ever they had been upon their own account: which is the caſe of the Books of the Old and New Teſtament. If the <hi>Jews</hi> (even the meaneſt and moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of them) could do this merely by their own Wit and Device, they muſt have a Genius
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:61773:176"/>ſuperiour to that of all Mankind beſides. For what imaginable Reaſon is there, why the Oracles of all the Heathen Nations ſhould never be much regarded, and now, in a manner, utterly loſt, and that the Books of the Jews ſhould ſtill be preſerved in their full Authority; but the power and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Truth in theſe, and the want of it in them?</p>
                        <p>And the Evidence of this Truth is moſt obſervable, in the mutual Dependence which all the Parts of the Scriptures have one upon another. They were penn'd by Men of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Countreys, different Ages, different Conditions and Callings and Intereſts, from the King to the poor Fiſherman; and yet all carry on the ſame Deſign: They are not like the Oracles of the Heathen Gods, which muſt ſtand or fall by themſelves; but there is an admirable Series and Connexion between all the Writings of the Holy Scriptures, by which the ſeveral Parts of them give a mutual ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and atteſtation to each other. The <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> contains the firſt Lineaments and evident Types and Prophecies of all that is contained in the reſt: He foretold, That a ſucceſſion of Prophets ſhould ariſe, and that at laſt the <hi>Great Prophet</hi> ſhould be ſent, who is Chriſt; and he foretold all that was to befall the <hi>Jews,</hi> from his own time, to the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And as <hi>Moſes</hi> has given us the general State of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:61773:177"/>all Generations; ſo the ſeveral Prophets, who were ſent from time to time, according to his Predictions, foretold particular Events and more-eſpecially they foretold and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the Times of the Goſpel. This was the great Deſign of all Prophecies, and the thing that God had ſpoken by the Prophets, <hi>which have been ſince the world bigan,</hi> Luk. i. 70. For in Chriſt was the Accompliſhment of all the Types and Prophecies in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>And this Dependance and Coherence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all the Parts of the Scriptures, in the Matter and Deſign of them, which is as great as the dependance of one part of any Book written by the ſame Author can be upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, gives great ſtrength and confirmation to the whole; ſince it is an Evidence, that it was all Inſpired by the ſame Infallible Spirit; and if one part of Scripture be proved to be true, all muſt be ſo: for beſides the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Evidence which may be brought for any part ſeparately, we muſt conſider the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion which it has with the reſt, and the Evidence which is derived upon it by this Connexion, if the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> be once proved to be of Divine Authority, than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets who ſucceeded <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt be Divinely Inſpired; becauſe he foretold the ſucceſſion of ſuch Prophets; And if the Prophecies and Miracles of the Prophets were Divine, the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> muſt be ſo; becauſe they all along
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:61773:177"/>acknowledged and appealed to it, as contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's Covenant with his People the <hi>Jews,</hi> and being therefore the ground and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own Miſſion. if <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets be from God, the Goſpel muſt be from him, if that be foretold by them: And if the Prophecies and Miracles of our Saviour and his Diſciples prove their Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets muſt be likewiſe of the ſame Authority; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they acknowledge them for ſuch, and prove their own Authority from them, as well as from the Miracles that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wrought. And if the Prophecies and Miracles either of <hi>Moſes</hi> or of the Prophets, or of our Saviour and his Apoſtles taken by themſelves, and apart from the reſt, be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, they muſt needs be more convincing, when they are conſidered together, in their united Force and Light.</p>
                        <p>I might further obſerve, That Miracles without Prophecies, or Prophecies without Miracles, or that one evident Miracle, or one evident Prophecy; at leaſt, That either the Miracles or prophecies of ſome one Perſon, in the ſeveral Ages in which ſo many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets lived, would have been a ſufficient ground of Faith, and that therefore they muſt all be much rather ſo in conjunction: But I ſhall only deſire it may be remembred, That whatever Evidence has been brought in proof of the Divine Authority of the Books of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:61773:178"/>
                           <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the Prophets, doth recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally prove both the one and the other; and that therefore whatever is brought from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, in Proof of the Goſpel, has the Evidence of the whole; and that the Goſpel in different reſpects doth prove them; and is proved by them, <hi>both</hi> deriving Authority from the Books of the Old Teſtament, and communicating its own Authority to them: For as the Cauſe may be proved by its Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and the Effect by its Cauſe; ſo both Predictions prove the Things foretold; and the accompliſhment of the Things foretold, verifie the Predictions; and Miracles wrought in conſequence of Prophecies concerning them, have doubly the Divine Seal and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation. Now, the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is the Scope and Centre of the whole Old Teſtament, as the <hi>Jews</hi> them ſelves ever underſtood it; and what ever Teſtimony is produced from thence, brings with it the Evidence of the whole: And a like Evidence is again reflected upon the whole Old Teſtament, by the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any part of it in the New, and by the appeal which our Saviour and his Apoſtles conſtantly made to it.</p>

                        <p>THat in the reign of <hi>Tiberius</hi> there lived ſuch a Perſon as Jeſus Chriſt, who ſuffered

                              <hi>Tacit. Annal.</hi> lib. 25.</note> under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly written by <hi>Tacitns:</hi> and that he cured Diſeaſes and wrought other Miracles, was never denied by the worſt Enemies to the Chriſtian name and Doctrine. So that the ſubſtance of the Hiſtory of the Life and Death of our Saviour, is acknowledged by our very Adverſaries, and the Power, by which he wrought his Miracles, is the thing which was in diſpute between them and the Primitive Chriſtians. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall take the obſervations which I make concerning our Bleſſed Saviour, from that account which the Evangeliſts give of him, which is in great part confeſſed by the Jews and Heathens, and which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves at leaſt the ſame credit that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hiſtories do, till it can be diſproved, and in the following Chapters I ſhall ſhew, that it is infallibly true.</p>
                        <p>The Divine Nature of our B. Saviour is of another conſideration: we are in this place to conſider him, according to the Appearance he made in the World: and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:61773:179"/>this was ſuch as ſhewed him to be void of all ambitious and aſpiring thoughts, and to be meek and humble, and perfectly vertuous and holy: his Miracles were wrought without vanity and oſtentation, and never out of Revenge, or to ſhew his Power over his Enemies, but always with a gracious and merciful deſign: he avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all opportunities of Popularity; he would not intermeddle in private affairs, when he was appealed to; and made his eſcape, when the people would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him by force to make him a King, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had ſeen the Miracle of the Loaves; by which it appeared that he, who was able to ſuſtain ſo many thouſands in the Wilderneſs, might have raiſed and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained what Army he pleaſed, and might have made himſelf as great as he would, notwithſtanding any oppoſition.</p>
                        <p>He dealt freely and generouſly with his Diſciples, not deluding them with vain hopes, nor promiſing them great Matters, but checking their aſpiring Thoughts and telling them truly and plainly, that they were to expect nothing but miſeries in this World from the Profeſſion of his Doctrine; he put it to their own choice, whether they would take up their Croſs and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him; and when he was betray'd by one of thoſe very Diſciples, he uſes no up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding or reproachful Language, but
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:61773:179"/>beſpeaks him with a Divine Patience and Meekneſs: Noman ever ſuffer'd with ſo much injuſtice and cruelty, nor ever any man with ſo great compaſſion and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards all his Enemies.</p>
                        <p>He lived a mean and deſpiſed Life, and never was in ſuch a condition as could tempt any man to flatter him, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal any fault, if he had been guilty of any: and he had always many Enemies, who endeavoured to faſten the worſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies upon him, but their malice tended only to render his Innocence the more manifeſt and illuſtrious.</p>
                        <p>The perſon who betray'd him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him into the hands of his Enemies, was <hi>one of the Twelve,</hi> one of his own Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Apoſtles, whom he had ſent out to gain Proſelytes, and had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him a Power of working Miracles, and of doing whatſoever was requiſite to gain Reception for his Religion in the World. <hi>Judas</hi> was one of the Twelve, who were neareſt to him, and were admitted to all the ſecrets of his Kingdom, and were entruſted with the moſt hidden Myſteries, and obſcure Doctrines of his Religion; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was ſpoken to others in Parables, was explained afterwards to them in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate: nothing was with-held from them, which it was convenient for them to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted withal, or which they were capable
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:61773:180"/>of knowing. Nay, <hi>Judas</hi> ſeems to have had a particular mark of Favour plac'd upon him, in that he was the keeper of the Bag; for it was an Office of ſome Truſt and Confidence; however, it gave him an opportunity of knowing, whether his Maſter had any ſuch ambitious deſigns, as he was accuſed of. For if he had <hi>perverted the Nation, and forbidden to give Tribute to Caeſar,</hi> and had endeavour'd to ſet himſelf up as King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which was the charge laid againſt him before <hi>Pilate,</hi> ſuch a Project could not have been carried on without amaſſing a great Treaſure, which therefore, if any ſuch thing had been in hand, <hi>Judas</hi> had been beſt able to give an account of. But when one who had conſtantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended upon him and was ſo intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all the ſecrets of his Life and Doctrin, had nothing to alledge againſt him, after he had betray'd him, what could make more for his Juſtification, or be a clearer De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of his Innocence? When men are once prevail'd upon to turn Traytors they ſeldom do things by halves, but if there be the leaſt pretence or colour to be found, they will be ſure to lay hold of it to juſtify their villany. And it is the moſt undeniable proof our Saviours's Innocence, that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery it ſelf could diſcover nothing to faſten upon him: but tho' <hi>Judas</hi> had been ſuborned by the chief Prieſts to betray his Maſter for thirty pieces of Silver, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:61773:180"/>that nor a greater ſum, (which we may be confident would not have been denied him) could prevail with <hi>Judas</hi> himſelf, to undertake to appear as a witneſs againſt him.</p>
                        <p>When one of his own Diſciples was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, or rather had offer'd of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to betray him, it could not be imagin'd, but that the Chief Prieſts would urge him to come in, as a witneſs to the Accuſations which they had framed againſt him; this had been a much a more acceptable ſervice to them, than barely to deliver him up; for what could have brought a greater diſgrace upon his Perſon, or more diſcredit upon his Religion, than for one of his own Diſciples to witneſs againſt him, that the <hi>had committed things worthy of Death?</hi> Men, who were at ſuch a loſs for matter to charge Chriſt with and at laſt could not make their Witneſſes agree together, would never, we may be ſure have omitted ſuch an opportunity as this of loading him with infamy, and ſtifling his Doctrine in his death. And he who was ſo ready and forward to betray his <hi>maſter</hi> wou'd never have ſtuck at accuſing him, if he had had any thing to ſay againſt him; and no other reaſon can be given why he did not do it, but that he was over-awed by that Innocence and Holineſs, which he knew to be in him, and was ſeiz'd with that remorſe of Conſcience and terrour of Mind, as not to be able to bear up under the guilt of what he had
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:61773:181"/>already done. For <hi>Judas, who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him, when he ſaw that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, repented himſelf, and brought again the thirty pieces of Silver to the Chief Prieſts and Elders, ſaying, I have ſinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood: And they ſaid, What is that to us, ſee thou to that; And he caſt down the pieces of Silver in the Temple, and went and hanged himſelf,</hi> Matt. xxvii. 3, 4. How could the Chief Prieſts themſelves have contrived a better way to vindicate our Saviour's Innocence, if they had never ſo much endeavour'd it, than for one of his own Diſciples after he had betrayed him, inſtead of witneſſing againſt him, which it was natural to ſuppoſe he would have done, to be ſo far from that, as to come before them all, and fling down the Money in the Temple, which they had given him as the hire of his Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and declare publickly, that he had betrayed the Innocent Blood; and then to give a further proof of all this, out of meer anguiſh and horror of Mind, to go imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from them, and hang himſelf?</p>
                        <p>If our Saviour had done any thing, whereby he could deſerve to be put to Death, <hi>Judas</hi> muſt needs have known it, and when he had once betray'd him, it cannot be ſuppoſed he would forbear to diſcover any thing he knew of him. But when on the contrary he was ſo far from
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:61773:181"/>accuſing him, that as ſoon as he ſaw him condemned at the Accuſation of other falſe Witneſſes, he could not bear the Agonies of his own mind, but went and made away with himſelf; this is as evident a proof of Chriſt's Innocence, as any of the other Apoſtles themſelves could ever give; and <hi>Judas</hi> is ſo far an Apoſtle ſtill, as to proclaim his Maſter's Innocence in the face of the <hi>Sanedrim,</hi> and then to Seal that Teſtimony with his Blood.</p>
                        <p>It has been thought by ſome, that <hi>Judas,</hi> as wicked as he was, had never any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to cauſe his Maſter to be put to Death, or to be any way inſtrumental towards it, but he ſuppoſed that Chriſt would be ſecure enough againſt the Chief Prieſts in his own Innocence and Holineſs, or that they would not dare to hurt him for fear of the People, which had been a reſtraint upon them in their former attempts; or that he could eaſily make his eſcape from them, as he had formerly done, and therefore his Covetouſneſs tempted him to believe, that though he ſhould betray his Maſter, yet he would come to no harm by it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it is certain, that <hi>Judas</hi> himſelf clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Saviour's ſnnocence by betraying him more than any other man could have done, who had not been his Dlſciple, and his making that confeſſion, and then his dying upon that account, and in that manner,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:61773:182"/>may afford us that evidence, which we muſt have wanted, to certify us in the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, if Chriſt had not been betray'd, or had been betrayed by any but one of his own Diſciples.</p>
                        <p>When he was condemned and crucify'd one of the Thieves, who was crucified with him, made an open Profeſſion of him; when there could be no Temptation of flattery, nor leiſure or patience for a man in that condition to ſpeak in that manner, but by the ſpecial Providence and Grace of God, and to give an early inſtance of the great efficacy of his Croſs, and of the Mercy, which it reacheth forth to all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting Sinners, our Saviour aſſures him, that that very day he <hi>ſhould be with him in Paradiſe.</hi> A ſtrange diſcourſe upon the Croſs! To ſpeak of Kingdoms, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe Paradiſe, under ſo much infamy and torment! That one ſhould have the Faith to ask, and the other the Power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſo great things in that condition! Who could have had the courage to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſo much upon the Croſs, but he, who was able to perform it?</p>
                        <p>And as no ill could ever be proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, but all circumſtances concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to confirm his Innocence; as <hi>Herod</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed him, and <hi>Pilate</hi> often declared him to have committed nothing worthy of Death: ſo the Devils themſelves, during
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61773:182"/>his Life here upon Earth, confeſſed him to be the Son of God, and after his Death,

                        <p>And this perſon, thus Innocent and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both in his Life and Doctrine, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of many Ages before his Birth, and all the Prophecies concerning the Meſſias were exactly and in a wonderful manner fulfilled in him.

                        <p n="1">1. The Prophecies concerning the Birth of the Meſſias were fulfilled in our Saviour. For his Birth was propheſied of in all the circumſtances of the Time, and the Place of it, and the Perſon of whom he was born.</p>

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:61773:183"/>the Jews among all their objections, never objected againſt the time in which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour came into the World, but many of them have confeſſed that the Meſſias was born at that time, but ſay, that becauſe of their ſins he has
<note n="(e)" place="margin">Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter de Meſſiâ.</note> concealed himſelf ever ſince. And the latter Jews have, by a great many ſtories, endeavoured to make it believed, that there is a Kingdom ſtill of their Nation, in ſome unknown part of the world; tho' if this were true, it could prove nothing to their purpoſe, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy being concerning their Power and Authority in the promiſed Land.</p>
                        <p>It is certain, that ſoon after our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's coming, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was deſtroyed, and the Jews diſperſed, and upon ſevere Penalties forbidden to come to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate and ruined City, or ſo much as to look upon <hi>Zion,</hi> the City of their Solemnities, unleſs it were once every year to lament their calamity; and they have ever ſince been a wandring and deſpicable People. And ſeveral times, when they have at tempted to re-build their Temple, they have not been ſuffered to do it; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, when they had the favour and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, who, out of malice to the Chriſtian Name and Doctrine, was forward to promote the work, they were hindred by an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and a miraculous eruption of Fire
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:61773:183"/>burſting out from under the foundation, which burnt down what they had erected, and deſtroyed thoſe that were employed in it; and this we have atteſted not only from Chriſtian writers, who lived near that time,
<note n="(f)" place="margin">Ammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellin. lib 23. c. 1.</note> but by an eminent Heathen Hiſtorian of the ſame Age. Now it was foretold by the prophets <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Malachy,</hi> that Chriſt ſhould come before the deſtruction of the Second Temple, and the deſtruction of this Temple was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by <hi>Daniel,</hi> with the preciſe time of our Savour's coming; and to manifeſt to the world that Chriſt is come, and that therefore the Jewiſh Worſhip and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is utterly at an end, as the Prophets had foretold, God has been pleaſed in ſo mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and terrible a manner to ſhew, that he will not ſuffer their Temple to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built, and whereas the Meſſias was to come to the Second Temple, now for ſo many hundreds of years, they have had no Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at all for him to come to.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As the time of Chriſt's Birth was foretold by the Prophets, ſo was the place likewiſe, and that was <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> a ſmall City, and therefore the more unlikely in all humane account to have that honour beſtowed upon it, to become the Birth place of him, who, the Jews expected, ſhould be a Temporal Prince: yet this when ſo well underſtood by the Jews of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:61773:184"/>that time, notwithſtanding their miſtaken notion of a Temporal Meſſias, that <hi>when Herod gathered all the Chief Prieſts and Scribes of the people together, and demanded of them, where Chriſt ſhould be born,</hi> they anſwered him with one conſent, <hi>in Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem of Judaea,</hi> and quoted the Prophecy of <hi>Micah</hi> for the proof of it, <hi>Matt.</hi> ii. And many believed that Jeſus was the Meſſias or the Chriſt, which they then were in expectation of; others made this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he could not be the Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he came out of <hi>Galilee:</hi> but <hi>hath not the Scripture ſaid, that Chriſt cometh of the ſeed of David, and out of the Town of Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem, where David was?</hi> This was the great objection againſt our Saviour, that he could not be the Chriſt, becauſe he did not come out of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> but out of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee:</hi> for they thought he had been born at <hi>Nazareth</hi> in <hi>Galilee,</hi> not at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> whereas he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and that by ſo ſtrange and particular a providence, as doth evidently prove him to be the Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>For <hi>it came to paſs in theſe days, that there went out a decree from Caeſar Auguſtus, that all the world ſhould be taxed,</hi> and regiſtred according to their Families; <hi>and all went to be taxed, every one into his own City,</hi> into the City, which belonged to his
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61773:184"/>Lineage and Family. <hi>And Joſeph alſo went up from Galilee out of the City of Nazareth into Judaea unto the City of David, which is called Bethlehem (becauſe he was of the Houſe and Lineage of David) to be taxed with Mary his eſpouſed Wife, being great with Child; and ſo it was, that while they were there the days were accompliſhed, that ſhe ſhould be delivered,</hi> Luke ii. 1, &amp;c. Here we ſee, that their going from <hi>Nazareth</hi> to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> was not in the leaſt deſigned by the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> but they were obliged to go thither by a new and ſtrange decree of the Emperor, and accordingly they went in Obedience to this Decree. If the Bleſſed Virgin had dwelt at <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> though the Prophecy had been fulfilled, yet there had been nothing in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances extraordinary; if ſhe had gone thither of her own accord, or if ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate buſineſs had called her thither, this might have been looked upon as a contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and a deſign to be thought the Mother of the Meſſias; if God himſelf had by an immediate Revelation ſent her thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet this ſtill had been liable to cavils, and might have been ſuſpected of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. But when at the Command of an Heathen Prince, and ſuch a command as had never been given out at any time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was forced upon a long and tedious Journey, at an unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:61773:185"/>time of the year, being then great with Child, and therefore very unfit for ſuch a Journey, and not in a condition to have the leaſt inclination or thought of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking it, when ſhe was obliged by ſo unexpected and unwelcom a command to repair to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and was at that very time delivered of her Son; all theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſo wonderfully concurring, have ſomething more convincing in them, than can well be expreſs'd.</p>
                        <p>And 'tis obſervable, that this Tax or Regiſter was deſigned and begun in ſome parts of the Empire 27 years before, but was hindred by diſturbances, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, upon which account anciently the <hi>Spaniards</hi> begun their <hi>Aera</hi> 27 years before the computation of other Chriſtians, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that the Taxing mentioned in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> had been at the ſame time, that it was begun amongſt them ſo many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but the divine Providence ſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things, that it ſhould not be carried on then, but ſhould be deferred till that very time when Chriſt was to be born, that by this means <hi>Bethlehem</hi> might be the place of his Birth.</p>
                        <p>And by the ſame ſpecial Providence it came to paſs, not only that this Prophecy was fulfilled concerning his being born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> but that it ſhould be regiſtered in the Publick Records of the Empire, to
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:61773:185"/>which <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> appeal in their Apologies for the proof of it; and St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> mentions them, as extant at <hi>Rome</hi> in his time, near four hundred years after the Birth of our Saviour. And his being born there, proves that he was of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> as it was propheſied that the Meſſias ſhould be: for the Decree required that all ſhould reſort to the City of their Lineage or Family, and <hi>Bethlehem</hi> was the City of <hi>David.</hi> So that from our Saviour's being born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and that by ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable a Providence, without any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane foreſight or deſign: we have two evident proofs that he is the Chriſt, he was of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> and was born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and this was atteſted by the Publick Records, or Cenſual Tables at <hi>Rome,</hi> which were often appealed to for the Truth of it, and were remaining to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted for ſeveral hundred years afterwards.

                        <p n="3">3. The perſon of whom our Saviour was born, had been likewiſe foretold.

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:61773:186"/>perſon, that ſhe was to be a Virgin: all were particularly foretold by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and accordingly expected at that time by the Jews.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the Tribe and Family of which our Saviour was born I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that effectual care was taken by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> to keep a perpetual diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſeveral Tribes and Families: for by the Law of the Inheritances, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance could paſs out of a Family ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſale of Lands (for every fiftieth year was a year of Redemption, and <hi>every man returned to his own Poſſeſſion, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to his own Family,</hi> Lev. xxv. io.) Or by defect of Heirs Male; for if there were Daughters, they were to inherit, and if there were no Daughter, it was to Paſs to the neareſt Kinſman, <hi>Numb.</hi> xxvii. and the Daughters who were Heireſſes, were obliged to marry to one of the Family of the Tribe of their Fathers, <hi>Numb.</hi> xxxvi. 8. But if a man died without Children, his Brother, or his next Kinſman was to raiſe up Seed unto the deceaſed, and the Firſt born was to <hi>ſucceed in the name</hi> of him that died without iſſue, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxv. 5, 6. <hi>Ruth</hi> iii. 12.

And that a Virgin ſhould bear a Son can ſeem to no man incredible who will but conſider, that the God of Nature cannot be confined to the Laws of his own Inſtitution, and that to make Man of the Duſt of the Earth, or by other means than by natural Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the firſt Man and Woman muſt certainly be made, whatever <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> be admitted is as unaccountable, and as wonderful as this can be. But to make this Conception of the Bleſſed Virgin the more eaſily believed, the Birth of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> when his Mother <hi>Sarah</hi> was old, and had been barren, and other Births of the like nature, were both Types of Chriſt's Birth, and an evidence of the power of God above the courſe of Nature; particularly St. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> being born of a Mother,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:61773:187"/>who was both old and barren, was in this as well as in other things, the fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>But this Virgin was to be eſpouſed to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> a juſt and good man, both that he might be a ſecurity and protection to her, and might be aſſiſting to her, in her care and tenderneſs for the Bleſſed Infant; and likewiſe that he, who was moſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make the diſcovery, if it had been otherwiſe, might teſtify to the world, that an Angel from Heaven had ſatisfied him, that ſhe was with Child of the H. Ghoſt. <hi>Jealouſy,</hi> the wiſe man ſays, <hi>is the rage of a man, therefore be will not ſpare in the day of vengeance: he will not regard any ranſom, nither will he be content, though thou giveſt him many gifts,</hi> Prov. vi. 34, 35. And the Jewiſh Law in this caſe was as ſevere, as any could well be: For a Virgin betroth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who had been thus found guilty, was to be ſtoned to Death, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxii. 23. And though <hi>Joſeph not being willing to make her a publick example was minded to put her away privately,</hi> yet this ſhews, that if it had prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as he at firſt ſuſpected, he was not a man, that would have been inſenſible of the Injury; and it is a good evidence that there was nothing to be objected, when there was nothing that jealouſy could object; and no Teſtimony could poſſibly have ſatisfied thoſe, who will not
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:61773:188"/>be ſatisfied though <hi>Joſeph</hi> himſelf teſtified, that <hi>the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a Dream, ſaying Joſeph, thou Son of David, fear not to take unto thee, Mary thy Wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And his carrying the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant into <hi>Egypt</hi> at another appearance of an Angel, and all his Behaviour ſhews, that as he was the moſt competent perſon to deliver this Meſſage of the Angel to the world, ſo he was the moſt zealous and forward aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerter of this Article of our Faith.</p>
                        <p>And beſides his firſt ſuſpicions, his other prejudices and diſcouragements muſt be ſo great, that nothing but a clear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Revelation could poſſibly remove them; he could expect nothing but trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and danger to himſelf; he could not hope to be reputed the Father of the Meſſias, ſince the Prophets had fortold, that he was to be born of a Virgin; and nothing could be more contrary to the expectation the Jews had of him than that he ſhould be a Carpenter's Son, this was thought by them a ſufficient reaſon to reject both his Doctrine and his Miracles. And <hi>Joſeph</hi> had no cauſe to flatter himſelf that it would be otherwiſe: <hi>Simeon</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of Chriſt, that he was <hi>ſet for a ſign, which ſhould be ſpoken againſt,</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> preſently ſeeks to take away his Life by a terrible Maſſacre: yet <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſo
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:61773:188"/>well ſatisfied of the Angels Revelation to him, and was ſo well aſſured of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of it, that he willingly expoſed himſelf to all the inconveniencies and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which he could not but ſee muſt be the neceſſary conſequence of it, and which he ſoon ſaw come ſo thick and violently upon him. <hi>A Sword was to pierce through the Virgins own Soul alſo:</hi> but all the hazards and the ſorrows, which were foretold them, and which accordingly they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went, may abundantly convince us, that they could have no deſign or proſpect of any advantage, but of declaring the Truth, and of that Salvation, which was brought to them and to all Mankind by it.</p>
                        <p>Thus we ſee that both the Time and Place of our Saviour's Nativity, and the Perſon of whom he was born, are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proofs of his being the Chriſt.

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:61773:192"/>buried when they were. <hi>He made inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for the Tranſgreſſors,</hi> for the Penitent Thief in particular, whom he promiſed, that he ſhould be with him that day in Paradiſe, and for his Perſecutors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, praying that they might be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given. The Prophecies of this Chapter are ſo very plainly and directly fulfilled, that I have known a Child apply them to the Paſſion of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>One of the moſt glorious Characters, by which the Meſſias was deſcribed by the Prophets, was, that he ſhould be their Prince and King, and this led the Jews into that fatal miſtake of a Temporal Meſſias: for Meſſias or Anointed, ſignifies King as well as Prophet or Prieſt, (in which three Offices Unction was uſed, and they were all united in our Saviour, who was the Meſſias anointed and inaugurated by the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt upon him in a viſible ſhape, and with a diſtinct and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible voice declaring him to be the Son of God. And that all the world might know our Saviour to be the King of the Jews, that Title was fixt upon his Croſs in three ſeveral Languages, the moſt vulgar Tongues then in the world, that no Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might be ignorant, that Chriſt the King of the Jews was then crucified. For <hi>Pilate</hi> would not alter the Inſcription; but though they had frighted him before by
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:61773:192"/>obſerving to him, that it was Treaſon againſt <hi>Caeſar</hi> to call any one King beſides him, yet when they would now have had him change the Inſcription, and have written only, <hi>that he ſaid, I am King of the Jews, Pilate</hi> gave a ſhort and reſolute An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>what I have written, I have written.</hi> How much ſoever it were at his Peril to provoke a malicious people, in a point wherein they thought the honour and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Nation ſo much concerned, and in a point, which could not but be exceeding tender to ſo jealous an Emperor as <hi>Tiberius;</hi> but <hi>Pilate</hi> had ſuffered himſelf to be carried too far already againſt his own Conſcience, and had ſhewn great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to their proceedings, in the whole management of his Tryal; and the ſame providence, which had ordered every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance to the manifeſtation of the Truth, and the conviction both of the Jews and Gentiles, now ſo diſpoſed this remarkable particular, that the laſt period of his Life, in oppoſition to all the ſpight of the Jews, ſhould be adorned and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified with his true Title and Character, under which he had been foretold by the Prophets, in Capital Letters upon his Croſs.</p>
                        <p>Thus were the Prophecies concerning the Birth, and Life, and Death of the Meſſias, exactly fulfilled in our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:61773:193"/>which were ſo many, that they could not be fulfilled by chance, and the fulfilling of them depended ſo much upon the words and actions of others, and even of his worſt Enemies, that it could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from no deſign or contrivance of him or his Diſciples: They were fulfilled in him by the malice chiefly of his Enemies, and according to the interpretation which they themſelves were wont to give of them.</p>

                        <p>Our Saviour's Miracles verified the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, which had been concerning the Meſſias; for the Jews expected that the Meſſias ſhould manifeſt himſelf by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to the world, as they concluded from the ancient Prophets: and therefore St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> did no Miracles that he might not be miſtaken for the Meſſias, of whom Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were a principal Token to know him by. His Miracles were wrought in the midſt of his Enemies, and extorted a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion from the Devils themſelves of his Divine Power; they were of that nature, that it was impoſſible for them before whom they were wrought, to be impoſed upon by them, and as impoſſible for them to be performed but by the immediate Power of God. The Miracle of the Loaves and Fiſhes was twice done, and the Perſons who were Witneſſes to it, were at one time <hi>five thouſand men, beſides Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> Matt. xiv. 21. and the other time <hi>four thouſand men, beſides Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> Matt. xv. 38. a Miracle wrought at two ſeveral times, and obvious to all the ſences of ſo many thouſand Men, beſides Women and Children, who being hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, found themſelves filled and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

                        <p>But the Reſurrection of Chriſt which was the Accompliſhment of theſe Types and Prophecies being matter of fact, muſt be proved, as all other matters of fact are, by Witneſſes: and the Apoſtles in a body offered themſelves as Witneſſes to teſtify this great Article of our Faith. <hi>This Jeſus hath God raiſed up, whereof we all are Witneſſes,</hi> Act. ii. 32. The thing therefore to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, is, whether they were effectually qualified to be Witneſſes in this matter, and to prove that they had all the qualifications which can be required in any Witneſs, I ſhall ſhew, 1. That they had certain knowledge of the thing which they were Witneſſes of, and could not be deceived themſelves in it. 2. That they would not deceive others, having no temptation to it, but acting againſt all the Intereſts and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of this world. 3. That they alledge ſuch circumſtances, as made it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to deceive thoſe, to whom they teſtified the Truth of Chriſt's Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, though they had had never ſo much mind to do it. And when Men teſtify things which they have ſuch means and opportunities of knowing, as make it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to be miſtaken in them, when they can have no advantage but by telling the Truth, and can expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſufferings from it in this Life, when they produce ſuch circumſtances as
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:61773:199"/>put it out of their own power to deceive; and ſuch as thoſe, before whom they ſpeak, may know to be falſe, if they be ſo; this certainly is all that can be deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any Witneſs.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. The Apoſtles, who were Witneſſes of our Saviour's Reſurrection, could not be deceived themſelves in it. They were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver far from being credulous, and eaſy of belief, as they ſhewed upon all occaſions, and particularly they never could be brought to believe the Doctrine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reſurrection of Chriſt, till their own ſenſes had convinced them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had wrong notions and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of it, and either miſunderſtood and miſapplied all that had been ſaid to them about it, or whatever they knew, or believed concerning it before, they had no expectations of it when he was once dead.</p>
                        <p>Our Saviour had in expreſs terms fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told his Reſurrection upon the third day ſeveral times, <hi>Matt.</hi> xvi. 21. xvii. 23. xx. 19. But his Diſciples did not rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, or throughly conſider what he ſaid to them, though he expreſt himſelf in the plaineſt words: For they were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up with great thoughts and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations of an earthly Kingdom and of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Power and Honour; at one time <hi>Peter took him, and began to rebuke him,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:61773:200"/>ſaying, Be it far from thee, Lord, this ſhall not be unto thee,</hi> Matt. xvi. 22. and at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time juſt before his paſſion, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had no ſooner done ſpeaking to them of his Crucifixion, and his riſing again the third day, but the two Sons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> Petitioned, that <hi>one might ſit on the right hand, and the other on the left in his Kingdom,</hi> and the reſt of the Diſciples were moved with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt them for preferring ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; and it appears from our Saviour's diſcourſe to them upon it; that their minds were all bent upon the thoughts of temporal Glory and Dominion, <hi>Matt.</hi> xx. 20. And after our Saviour had told them, that he muſt be put to death, and riſe again the third day, St. <hi>Luke</hi> adds, <hi>that they underſtood none of theſe things, and this ſaying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were ſpoken,</hi> Luke xviii. 34. and we find the ſame expreſſion before, <hi>Luke</hi> ix. 45. Even after our Saviour had eaten the Paſſover with them, and inſtituted the Sacrament of his Body, which was juſt then to be given up and to be Crucified; and of his Blood which was to be ſhed for them they were ſtill intent upon Temporal things and had expectations of being advanced to places of Authority and Preheminence. <hi>And there was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The Apoſtles and Evangeliſts write with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any deſign, or any end to ſerve but that of telling the truth; and therefore they conceal nothing of their own failings and faults, though they might prove ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo diſgraceful to them; they acquaint us that they were ambitious, and had a vain proſpect of Temporal Grandeur, that they were timorous, and of little Faith, till the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt upon them; which appears in nothing more than in this point of the Refur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. They were Men of no great na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Capacity, or quick apprehenſion, and they had ſometimes found themſelves mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in underſtanding that literally, which was ſpoken to them in Parables; and it is natural for Men to run from one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream to another, and uſual for ignorant and unlearned Men to imagine difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, where there are none: and this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their wiſhes and longings after tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Greatneſs, made them take all that was ſaid to them concerning the Paſſion and Reſurrection of Chriſt, in ſome ſuch ſenſe as might anſwer their hopes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of temporal Felicity: but when his Crucifixion had undeceived them in this conceit, they were in ſuch confuſion and conſternation of mind, as not to be able <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:61773:201"/>they had no hopes or expectation of. The Spirits of Men are commonly as low as their Education, and their condition and ſtation in the world is, and are eaſily ſunk and depreſſed much lower by any great and ſudden calamity: and Men, who were born in ſo mean a condition, and had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained a conceit of great and vain hopes, and then as unexpectedly fell from them, muſt be ſo dejected at it, that it is no wonder that they thought of nothing but their ſorrows, and had little heart to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any poſſibility of relief from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving of him, whom they had ſeen in that infamous and cruel manner put to Death. They were ſo poſſeſt with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of a temporal Kingdom, that when they had been convinced of the truth of his Reſurrection, and had afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed a long time with him, they could not put it out of their minds, <hi>Acts</hi> i. 6. and thetefore it is no ſtrange thing, that when they ſaw him Dead and in the Grave, they were forſaken of all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer hopes of the Redemption of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by him, <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 21. which before they had imagined to themſelves, was to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by his raiſing himſelf from that meanneſs to a Throne, not by his reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to Life again, after he had been buried three days The notion which the Jews had of a Reſurrection, was only
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:61773:201"/>that of the laſt day, <hi>John</hi> xi. 24. and whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was ſaid of any other Reſurrection, they looked upon it to be meant only in alluſion to that: they <hi>queſtioned one with another what the riſing from the Dead ſhould mean, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not that ſaying, and were afraid to ask him,</hi> Mark ix. 10, 32.</p>
                        <p>The Apoſtles therefore and other Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were ſo far from being credulous, or forward to believe the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the Dead, that they were not only inquiſitive and careful not to be impoſed upon, but they were exceeding diffident. The Women that went to the Sepulchre, were ſo far from expecting to find him riſen from the Dead, that they carried with them a preparation of Spices to embalm his Corps, <hi>Mar.</hi> xvi. 1. and not finding the Body of the Lord Jeſus, they were much <hi>perplext</hi> at it, not remembring the words, which Jeſus had ſpoke to them concerning the Reſurrection, till the two Men, who ſtood by them in ſhining Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, had put them in mind of them, <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 4.8. But when they <hi>returned from the Sepulchre and told all theſe things to the eleven and to all the reſt, their words ſeemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not,</hi> verſe 9, 11. And <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> her ſelf, though ſhe had ſeen this viſion, yet went to them with this complaint, <hi>they have taken away the Lord out of the Sepulchre,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:61773:202"/>and we know not where they have laid him,</hi> Jo. xx. 2. Then <hi>Peter ran unto the Sepulchre, and ſtooping down beheld the Linen clòths laid by themſelves, and departed wondering in himſelf at that which was come to paſs,</hi> Luke xxiv. 12. St. <hi>John</hi> ran to the Sepulchre at the ſame time, and going into it <hi>ſaw and believed,</hi> but he declares, that <hi>as yet they knew not the Scripture, that he must riſe again from the Dead,</hi> Jo. xx. 8, 9. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> ſtands without ſtill weeping, and complains to the two Angels, who asked her the cauſe, <hi>they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him,</hi> v. 13. and again to our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not knowing him, but ſuppoſing him to have been the Gardner, <hi>Sir, if thou have born him hence tell me where thou haste laid him, and I will take him away,</hi> v. 15. And after ſhe was her ſelf convinced of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, when ſhe told his Diſciples, <hi>they believed not,</hi> Mark xvi. 11.</p>
                        <p>When our Saviour appeared to the two Diſciples in the way to <hi>Emaus,</hi> he found them reaſoning and talking together of all thoſe things which had happened, and they were ſorrowful at the thoughts of them, and when he enquired the reaſon, they give him ſuch an account, as ſhews the doubtful and deſponding apprehenſions they had of their preſent condition, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that he anſwers them with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:61773:202"/>rebuke, <hi>O fools and ſlow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have ſpoken,</hi> Luke xxiv. 25. And afterwards when theſe two were convinced themſelves, and told the reſt what had happened, <hi>neither believed they them,</hi> Mark xvi. 13. And when immediately upon this, Jeſus ſtood in the midſt of them, they were yet only ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified and frightned, and ſuppoſed, that they had ſeen a ſpirit, and when he ſpoke to them, and diſcourſed with them, <hi>why are ye troubled, and why do thoughts ariſe in your hearts? Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I my ſelf, handle me and ſee, for a ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones as ye ſee me have, and</hi> then <hi>ſhewed them his hands and his feet;</hi> yet ſtill after all this, <hi>they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not for joy but wondered,</hi> and were not ſettled in their Belief of what they had ſeen and heard, till he took meat and did eat it before them, <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 36. and then <hi>he opened their understandings, that they might underſtand the Scriptures, and declared them the Witneſſes of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.

                        <p>After all theſe Proofs, St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> one of the Twelve, not being with them when Jeſus had appeared to them, the other Diſciples told him, they <hi>had ſeen the Lord;</hi> but he was peremptory and reſolute in it, that he would not believe him to be alive
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:61773:203"/>again, except he ſhould <hi>ſee in his hands the print of the nails</hi> and <hi>put his finger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the print of the nails, and thruſt his hand into his ſide.</hi> After eight days Jeſus came to them again, and to convince St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> and take away all poſſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of incredulity for the future, he grants him the ſatisfaction he deſired, and ſays unto him: <hi>Reach hither thy finger and behold my hands, and reach hither thy hand and thruſt it into my ſide, and be not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs but believing:</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was ſo doubtful, is now fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by this infallible evidence, and breaks out into this confeſſion, <hi>My Lord and my God,</hi> Joh. xx. 27, 28.</p>
                        <p>Thus did Chriſt <hi>ſhew himſelf alive to his Apostles after his paſſion by many infallible proofs, being ſeen of them forty days,</hi> Act. 1.3. and not of them only, but of <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove five hundred brethren at once,</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 6. But the Apoſtles were his choſen <hi>Witneſſes, who did eat and drink with him after he roſe from the Dead,</hi> Act. x. 41. And when he aſcended into Heaven, he was taken up while they were in his preſence, and conveyed in a Cloud out of their ſight; and whilſt they were looking up after him ſtedfaſtly into Heaven, two An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſtood by them, and aſſured them, that as he aſcended into Heaven, ſo he ſhall in like mannner come down from thence
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:61773:203"/>to judge the World. And he afcended not alone, but with a great multitude of the Saints and Heavenly Hoſt, as we learn from a paſſage in a diſcourſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle

                        <p>All circumſtances therefore concur to ſhew, that the Apoſtles had ſufficient op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity fully to inform themſelves in all particulars; that they uſed all means to do it with their utmoſt care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; that they were ſuſpicious and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructful; and that nothing but the clear conviction of all their ſenſes, could have ſatisfied them. The Apoſtles had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with our Saviour for ſome years, and had ſeen his Miracles, and had been enabled by him to do the like, and they were never credulous, but always back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſlow of belief; and the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt was a ſurprizing thing to
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:61773:204"/>them: For though he had often plainly foretold it to them, yet the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their hopes of a Temporal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the great terrour and conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that his Death had put them into, had quite broke their Spirits, and thruſt all hopes or thoughts of a Reſurrection out of their minds, and they were very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought to a belief of it. But he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame their unbelief, and ſatisfied all their ſcruples by ſuch ways as muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, or elſe we can never be convinced, that there is any real man beſides our ſelves in the World, and that all the reſt are not mere Shadows and Ghoſts; they <hi>did eat and drink with him after he roſe from the dead;</hi> they all beheld the marks in his hands and in his ſide, and one of them, who would not otherwiſe be perſwaded to the belief of his Reſurrection, did thruſt his fingers into the Print of the Nails, by which he was faſtned to the Croſs, and his hand into the wound of his ſide, which was made by the Soldiers Spear, juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was taken down from it; ſo that they knew him as certainly to be riſen again as they had ever known him to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live before his Death.</p>
                        <p>The Apoſtles were ſo diffident, that our Saviour <hi>upbraided them with their unbelief and hardneſs of heart, becauſe they believed not them, which had ſeen him after he was
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:61773:204"/>riſen,</hi> Mark xvi. 14. But it is obſervable, that as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> was at firſt abſent, and was ſuffered afterwards to be ſo very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult of Belief; ſo it is ſaid of the two Diſciples, that were walking to <hi>Emaus,</hi> that <hi>their eyes were holden, that they ſhould not know him.</hi> It was purpoſely ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Divine Providence, that they might not readily know and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him, but that the manner of his Manifeſtation of himſelf to them might be an invincible argument againſt all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, that no Man might have any thing to object, when every circumſtance was as narrowly examined, and with as great caution and circumſpection and diffidence, as it could have been done by himſelf, if he had been there. For I think, we may challenge the boldeſt and ſubtileſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary to ſay, what he could have done more to diſcover the Truth, if he had been then living, and amongſt the Apoſtles, than was done by them. <hi>That, which we have heard,</hi> ſays St. <hi>John, which we have ſeen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of Life, (for the Life was manifeſted, and we have ſeen it and bear witneſs—) that which we have ſeen and heard declare we unto you,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.2, 3. which is all that is poſſible for any witneſs to ſay, as to any matter of Fact; and they, who could ſpeak and write
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:61773:205"/>in this manner, muſt be competent witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; if no other exception can lye againſt them, they certainly ſpeak home to the purpoſe and all that any Witneſs can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired or ſuppoſed to ſpeak.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. As the Apoſtles could not be deceived themſelves, ſo they would not deceive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, having no temptation to it, but acting againſt all the Intereſts, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of this world. And thoſe, who had denied or forſook Chriſt when he was living, would never have been ſo zealous and reſolute to ſuffer for him after he was Crucified, if they had not been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſured of his Reſurrection. It is not to be imagined, they would have ſuffered all manner of Torments and Deaths, only to bear Witneſs to a thing, they had known to be falſe; and it has been already proved, that they could not be deceived in it, but muſt have known it to be falſe, if it had been ſo; and therefore it muſt be true that Chriſt is riſen from the Dead, or elſe we muſt ſuppoſe the Apoſtles to have been of ſo different a nature from all the reſt of Mankind, as to delight in the things, which all others fear and abhor, even in Bonds and Impriſonments, in infamy and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and all the puniſhments that can be inflicted: he that would endure all theſe for the ſake of what he knew to be falſe, muſt ſurely not be of humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:61773:205"/>and we may as well doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Apoſtles were Men, as we are, as whether Chriſt did riſe from the Dead.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. They alledged ſuch circumſtances, as made it impoſſible for them to deceive thoſe to whom they teſtified the Truth of Chriſt's Reſurrection, though they had had never ſo much mind to do it. They declared that that Jeſus whom the Jews had cauſed to be Crucified, and had then placed a Guard of Soldiers to ſecure his Sepulchre, leſt his Diſciples ſhould take him away, was notwithſtanding all their care riſen from the Dead; and that that Report of the Jews, that his Diſciples came by night and ſtole him away while the Watch ſlept, was utterly falſe; nay that it was a ſuborned ſtory, and that the Chief Prieſts had given the Soldiers Money to ſay it. Now if Chriſt had not really been riſen, how eaſily had all this been diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and what a Provocation was this to the chief Prieſts to diſprove it? If they could, their Honour and Reputation, and their Intereſt with the People, was highly concerned to vindicate the Truth of the Report, which they had hired the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to give out; and if there had been no ſuch Report, what reaſon could St. <hi>Matthew</hi> have to pretend there was? And if againſt all Reaſon and common
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:61773:206"/>ſenſe, he had pretended ſuch a report, when there had been none, it muſt have been the greateſt diſſervice to his Cauſe, that could have been thought of. But when there was ſuch a report amongſt the Jews, that his Diſciples had ſtoln him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by night, if this could have been made good againſt them, would his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſo ſoon after in the very City where he had been Crucified, declare to the Face of the Chief Prieſts aſſembled in Counſel, <hi>the God of our Fathers hath raiſed up Jeſus, whom ye ſlew and hanged on a Tree, him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, and to give repentance to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and forgiveneſs of ſins, and we are his Witneſſes of theſe things,</hi> Acts v. 30, 31, 32. Was not this as much as could be ſaid, to challenge them to produce thoſe Soldiers, to confront them? But beſides the ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſtory, that Men ſhould be able to know what was done, when they confeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have been aſleep; the Apoſtles could ſoon have confuted that calumny by the Miracles, which they wrought by virtue of his Reſurrection: if the Soldiers had been aſleep, when the Body was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, yet the Jews were certainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, when they invented and ſpread the report, and when they ſaw the Miracles, and heard the ſtrange Languages, by which the Apoſtles proved it to be falſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           <pb n="309" facs="tcp:61773:206"/>and declared, that Chriſt was riſen by the Omnipotent Power of God.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, St. <hi>Matthew</hi> writes, that <hi>the Graves were opened, and many bodies of Saints which ſlept, aroſe and appeared unto many,</hi> Mat. xxvii. 52, 53. Many ſaw them, who are appealed to as Witneſſes of their Reſurrection. And the miraculous events at the Death of our Saviour, which were ſo many certain preſages and fore-runners of his Reſurrection, as the Earthquake, and the darkneſs of the Sun for three hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the midſt of the day, contrary to the courſe of Nature, the Moon being in the full; the rending the veil of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the like; theſe were things which muſt be notorious, and which could not have been pretended to have happened, but the whole People of the <hi>Jews</hi> muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to, as Witneſſes of them.</p>
                        <p>And it being a cuſtom for the Deputies of Provinces to certifie the Emperor of whatever happened conſiderable under their Government, the Reſurrection of our Saviour, with the Miracles which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied it, were ſo remarkable, that <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> gave an account both of his Miracles and his Reſurrection to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Tiberius;</hi> who thereupon propoſed it to the Senate, to have him taken into the number of their Gods, and made it puniſhable to accuſe any Man for being a

                           <pb n="310" facs="tcp:61773:208"/>Chriſtian during his Reign.

They both lived in the next Age and were both educated in a different Religion, and upon theſe and ſuch like Proofs, became Chriſtians, and they were Men of excellent Learning and Judgment: but no Man, who could write an Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, can be ſuppoſed to have ſo much confidence, and ſo little underſtanding, as to appeal to that account which <hi>Pilate</hi> ſent to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> concerning the Reſurrection of Chriſt, in Apologies dedicated and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor himſelf, and to the Senate, or the chief Magiſtrates of the Empire, if no ſuch account had ever been ſent, or none had been then extant to be produced. But, by the ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, both the Birth and the Reſurrection of our Saviour were inſerted into the publick Records at <hi>Rome,</hi> and were to be ſeen there for a long time after; and the Heathens in whoſe cuſtody they were, are deſired by the Primitive Chriſtians to conſult them: for they were content to put the matter upon this iſſue,

                           <pb n="311" facs="tcp:61773:208"/>that if they were reſolved not to believe what the Chriſtians ſaid, yet they would at leaſt credit their own Records.</p>
                        <p>Upon theſe Proofs and Reaſons, by the clear evidence and power of Truth, <hi>the word of God mightily grew and prevailed,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all that Prejudice and Malice, and every Vice could do to oppoſe it, in <hi>Rome</hi> and in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſelf: for in this very Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where our Saviour had been Crucified, and where it had been impoſſible to have made Proſelytes, if his Reſurrection had not been evidently proved beyond all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a confutation, great numbers were daily added to the Church. A Church was forthwith ſounded at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop appointed by the Apoſtles, and both the body of the People, and their
<note n="(e)" place="margin">Euſeb. Hiſt. lib. 4. c. 5.</note> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, being xv. in number, to the final Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Adrian,</hi> were <hi>Jews</hi> by Nation.</p>
                        <p>We ſee then, that as the Teſtimony of the Apoſtles is in it ſelf beyond all excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo it is of ſuch a nature, as to make it impoſſible for them to deceive, if they had intended it; but indeed no Men could have proceeded in that manner, or would have endeavoured it, who had had any intentions to deceive; and the event ſhewed, that it was the direct and plain evidence, and force of Truth, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported it ſelf, notwithſtanding all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices

                        <p>THE Principal Articles of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith being matters of Fact, as the Paſſion, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion of Chriſt, upon which the reſt depend; the great thing to be enquired into is, whether the Apoſtles had all the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations requiſite to become Witneſſes of matters of Fact. This has been already ſhewn as to the Reſurrection, and if in general we examine whether we may ſafely rely upon that credibility where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they Preached the Goſpel to the world, the enquiry will fall under theſe heads; I. Whether they were Men of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Abilities to diſcern and underſtand what they teſtified II. Whether they had ſufficient means and opportunities to know it. III. Whether they were Men of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, that without Artifice or Deſign, truly declared what they knew.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. That the Apoſtles were Men of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient underſtanding to become Witneſſes of a matter of Fact, was never doubted by
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:61773:209"/>any one, nor can it be queſtioned by ſuch as peruſe their Writings: and indeed who is there of any common ſenſe, that is not a competent Witneſs of what he ſees, and hears, and has the experience of, for ſo long time together? For,</p>
                        <p n="2">II. By their converſation with our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, both before his Paſſion, and after his Reſurrection, the Apoſtles had ſuch oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of knowing what they atteſted, that it was impoſſible for them to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in any part of it. It was a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary qualification of all the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that they ſhould have converſed with our Saviour before his Death, and have ſeen him after his Reſurrection. For when one was to be ordained in the room of <hi>Judas,</hi> to be a Witneſs with the reſt of Chriſt's Reſurrection, he was to be one, that had <hi>companied with them all the time that the Lord Jeſus went in and out among them, beginning from the Baptiſm of John unto that ſame day,</hi> that he was <hi>taken up from them,</hi> Act. i. 21, 22. They ſaw his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and heard his Doctrine, and knew his manner of Life, and had all the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and uſed all the means to inform themſelves that it was poſſible for Men to do: they were <hi>eye-witneſſes of His Majeſty,</hi> 2 Pet. i. 16. <hi>they had heard, and ſeen with their eyes, and had looked upon,</hi> or beheld and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for a long time together, <hi>and their
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:61773:210"/>hands had handled that,</hi> which was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their Teſtimony, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> i. 1, 2, 3. They had made all the ſearch into it, and had uſed all the exactneſs that could be, and were as diſtruſtful and as hard of belief, as any Men could have been, who are moſt ſuſpicious and jealous of being impoſed upon. And of theſe Apoſtles, two wrote the Life of our Saviour, and all bore wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Truth of what theſe wrote, and Preached the ſame things, where ever they came: Of the two other Evangeliſts, St. <hi>Mark</hi> had his information from St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> whoſe Diſciple and Companion he was, and St. <hi>Luke</hi> wrote his Goſpel from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he had of thoſe who were <hi>Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and Miniſters of the word,</hi> Luke i. 2. And he was the Companion and Diſciple of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was ſuch an enemy to Chriſtianity before his Converſion, that nothing leſs than a miraculous Power could have made that ſudden change in him; he probably muſt have ſeen our Saviour before his Paſſion, and then ſaw him again at his Converſion, and heard him ſpeaking to him from Heaven: So that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as well as the other twelve Apoſtles, had ſeen and heard our Saviour, and they were all convinced by their own ſenſes of what they delivered to others; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, he was ſeen after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection by many others, both Men and
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:61773:210"/>Women, and at one time was ſeen by above five hundred together, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 6. Of all the writers of the Books of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, there are but two who were not Eye-witneſſes to what they relate, and theſe two had their Relations from the Apoſtles and others, who were eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. The Apoſtles were Men of integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and without any Artifice or Deſign tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared what they knew. 1. They had no worldly Intereſt to advance by their Teſtimony, but ſuffered by it, and had a certain proſpect of ſuffering. 2. There are peculiar marks of ſincerity in all their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. They had no worldly intereſt to ſerve by their Teſtimony, but ſuffered by it, and had a certain proſpect of ſufferings. They could propoſe no advantage to themſelves of Gain, or Honours, or Pleaſures; but on the contrary, underwent a voluntrary Poverty, and Infamy, and Torments, which was all that they met with in this world for their Pains, and all that they could expect to meet with. They forſook all which they had; St. <hi>Matthew</hi> a gainful Employment, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> who wrote the moſt of any of the Penmen of the New Teſtament, loſt the favour of the Chief Prieſts, and the preferments, which a perſon of his Learning and Zeal might
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:61773:211"/>promiſe himſelf from them. St. <hi>Luke,</hi> a Phyſician by his profeſſion, left an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of Honour and Advantage, and the reſt loſt all they had and can any Man loſe more? All of them left an honeſt and ſecure livelihood, and expoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the hatred and contempt of all their neareſt Friends and Relations, whoſe love and eſteem, both by nature and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, they muſt be enclined moſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: and they became obnoxious to all the affronts, and outrage, and torments, which a furious zeal could inflict upon them. All which was no new or unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected thing to them; they ſaw what their Maſter had ſuffered, and could hope to fare no better than he had done. They were often forewarned by Chriſt long before hand, what muſt befal them, they were told that they muſt take up their Croſs and follow him, and could be his Diſciples upon no eaſier terms. He had ſet forth the reception which they muſt expect to meet with in the world, juſt in the ſame manuer as they found it, under the moſt frightful appearance that words could repreſent. And this they ſoon found as punctually true, as all the reſt that he had foretold to them: but though they found it ſo, and ſometimes were diſmiſſed with a ſevere charge to deſiſt from Preaching the Goſpel, and at other times eſcaped, and
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:61773:211"/>had an opportunity given them to avoid any further danger by Preaching it; they ever perſervered in it with the greateſt zeal and conſtancy, deſpiſing all dangers, and all ſorts of torments and deaths, and glorying ſtill and rejoicing, that they ſuffered in ſo good a Cauſe; and at laſt they ſealed their Doctrine with their Blood.</p>
                        <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> was in great reputation with the Chief Prieſts and Scribes and Phariſees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his converſion, and was employed by them in perſecuting the Church, and as often as he appeared before them, they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to accuſe him of but his profeſſion of a Religion which obliges all Men to the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt juſtice and holineſs. If the Apoſtles had not been the beſt, they muſt have been the worſt of Men for impoſing upon the world, under the pretence of a Divine Miſſion and Authority; and yet this they muſt do with no other deſign, but to promote virtue and holineſs; which no ill Man could deſign, to his own certain loſs and deſtruction in this world and the next: and the leſs Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve of the next world, the more fond they are to make ſure of this.</p>
                        <p>Ambition, and a deſire of Fame, and a Name after Death, rarely happens to Men of obſcure Birth and mean Education; and it was naturally impoſſible, that it ſhould now befal ſo many of them, without any ground or reaſon to expect it, when in all
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:61773:212"/>humane conſideration they had a certain proſpect of nothing but infamy after death, as well as of diſgrace, and want and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, during their lives. And no Man could reſolve upon atteſting any thing on ſuch terms, unleſs he had been abſolutely certain of the Truth of it, much leſs could ſo many ſet upon ſuch a deſign together: for as they could have no arguments to perſwade one another to enter upon ſuch an Attempt, ſo if they had once conſpir'd in it, they would ſoon have deſerted and diſcovered each other, when they lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the diſadvantages and difficulties imaginable, and had nothing to ſupport and unite them, but the truth and reality of what they delivered. And it is further obſervable, that in the firſt Ages of the Church, and the nearer Chriſtians were to the Apoſtles, the more zealous they were to live according to the Goſpel of Chriſt, and to die in defence of it: for they had then greater opportunities of informing themſelves of the Impoſture, if there had been any, and had therefore the greater means of being certified that there was none. And Men of great parts and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, ſuch as <hi>Sergius Paulus,</hi> Governour of <hi>Cyprus, Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Areo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagite, Juſtin Martyr, Tertullian</hi> and others, who were inquiſitive Men, and able to make a true judgment of things, upon a
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:61773:212"/>full examination of all particulars, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came early Converts to the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. There are peculiar marks of ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all the writings of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts. They were not ambitious of being known to the world by their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, but wrote only as they were
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Euſeb. Eccle. hiſt. lib. iii. 23.</note> by neceſſity drawn to it, for the further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Goſpel. And upon all occaſions they declare their own frailties and faults, and many times ſuch as could never have been known but from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. St. <hi>Matthew</hi> had ſpent the former part of his Life in no very creditable em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, but among Publicans and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as he ſays himſelf: for he leaves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to all Poſterity, the cenſure of his own Life, ſaying, that he <hi>ſat at the receit of cuſtom,</hi> Matt. ix. 9, 10. and ſtiling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>Matthew the Publican,</hi> Mat. x. 3. <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> obſerves that none of the other Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts have mentioned a thing ſo reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of him, as his having been a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, but St. <hi>Matthew</hi> only has written it of himſelf: For it was the opinion not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Euſebius</hi>

Or if <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> were the ſame perſon, St. <hi>Mark</hi> writes,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:61773:213"/>that <hi>Jeſus ſat at meat in Levi's houſe;</hi> and St. <hi>Luke,</hi> that <hi>Levi made him a great Feast in his own houſe;</hi> but St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſays only, <hi>as Jeſus ſat at meat in the houſe,</hi> not mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in whoſe houſe, though he omits no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that the others ſet down, but the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own Hoſpitality.</p>
                        <p>In St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Goſpel,
<note n="(c)" place="margin">Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tull. adv.

But immediately after St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s behaviour towards our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is fully related; which was ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly, as that he began even to rebuke Chriſt for ſpeaking of his ſufferings, and extorted that ſevere rebuke from meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ſelf, <hi>Get thee behind me, Satan.</hi> This St. <hi>Peter</hi> has left written of himſelf by St. <hi>Mark,</hi> who wrote by the approbation and direction of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> but the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part is paſt over in ſilence, though belonging to the ſame time and place So again, the Denial of St. <hi>Peter</hi> is related in all its circumſtances of aggravation, by
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:61773:213"/>St. <hi>Mark</hi> as well as by St. <hi>Matthew:</hi> and St. <hi>John, Matt.</hi> xxvi. <hi>Mark</hi> xiv. <hi>John</hi> xviii. He acquaints us, that without any Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Menaces, or the leaſt compulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at the bare queſtion of a poor Maid, he denying his Maſter, and that he deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him thrice, and the laſt time even with Oaths and Imprecations. A Man, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers theſe things of himſelf, plainly ſhews, that he is ſo far from all vanity and ſeeking his own praiſe, that he can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have no other aim or deſign, but to declare the Truth to the Glory of God, and the benefit of Mankind, tho it prove to be never ſo much to his own diſgrace. And they relate, that as ſoon as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was apprehended, all his Diſciples for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook him and fled, when they might have been able to have Witneſſed in his behalf, and to have confronted <hi>Judas,</hi> who they might well believe, would have turned his Accuſer, after he had betrayed him. But St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſoon repented, and both he and St. <hi>John</hi> took courage and returned to ſee what became of their Maſter, and both St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s denial, and their leaving their Maſter thus in his diſtreſs, might never have been known, unleſs they had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it themſelves.</p>
                        <p>The Reproofs, and ſometimes very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Reprehenſions, which were given them by Chriſt, could never have come to
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:61773:214"/>our knowledge but by their own infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as that they were blamed for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little Faith, <hi>Matt.</hi> xvi. 8. no Faith, <hi>Mark</hi> ix. 19. that our Saviour upbraided them with unbelief and hardneſs of heart <hi>Mark</hi> vi. 52. viii. 17. xvi. 14. for being fooliſh and ſlow of heart, to believe all that the Prophets have ſpoken, <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 25. They declare, that they were ambitious, and emulous, and fond of Temporal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; that they had very wrong Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſt and his Kingdom, and they ſet forth at large how timorous, and how difficult they were of belief, and how very ſcrupulous and diffident of Chriſt's Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                        <p>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the great Apoſtle of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> was the Apoſtle of the Circumciſion, by his Diſciple and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion St. <hi>Luke,</hi> has likewiſe left an account of himſelf, which none but a ſincere ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Man, regardleſs of his own praiſe, would ever have ſuffered to be given of him, St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſays, that the Witneſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt St. <hi>Stephen, laid down their cloaths at a young mans feet, whoſe Name was Saul,</hi> Acts vii. 58. and that he was <hi>conſenting to St. Stephen's death,</hi> which he repeats twice, and once from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s own mouth in his Speech to the Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> viii. 1. xxii. 20.

                              <pb n="323" facs="tcp:61773:214"/>threatnings and ſlaughter against the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Lord, went unto the high Prieſt, and deſired of him Letters to Damaſcus,</hi> Acts ix. 1. Theſe are not the words of one, that had a deſign to diſſemble or extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in favour of any one. And out of a deep ſenſe of this offence, though it were committed ignorantly in unbelief, St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares himſelf to be <hi>the leaſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> and <hi>not meet to be called an Apoſtle, becauſe he had perſecuted the Church of God,</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 9. and at another time ſtiles himſelf <hi>leſs than the leaſt of all Saints,</hi> Eph. iii. 8. <hi>and chief of ſinners,</hi> 1 Tim. i. 15. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing all to the Power and Grace of God. St. <hi>Luke</hi> relates, that there was <hi>a ſharp contention</hi> between St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> Acts xv. 39. and St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that he had withſtood St. <hi>Peter</hi> to the face, <hi>Gal.</hi> ii. 11, 14. So plain it is that they did not act by any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy between themſelves, and that the Truth was dearer to them than any thing beſides. In the mean time the Apoſtles have left behind them little or no account of their journeyings and labours and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, only St. <hi>Paul,</hi> mentions ſome things of himſelf upon a neceſſary occaſion; the reſt we have from St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and he ſpeaks chiefly of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and of him only till his firſt coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> and of St. <hi>Peter</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little in compariſon; of the reſt of the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:61773:215"/>Apoſtles ſcarce any thing in particular: ſo little deſign had they of propagating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a name to poſterity.</p>
                        <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſed all lawful compliances, and he, who when the honour of Religion was concerned, made ſo ſtout oppoſition to St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, at other times, when he might ſafely do it, <hi>became all things to all men.</hi> And he joyns others together with himſelf in the beginning of many of his Epiſtles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 1.2 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 1. <hi>Gal.</hi> i. 1. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> i. 1. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> i. 1.2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> i. 1. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon</hi> i. which was a great condeſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a kind of communicating his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to them, whom he took, as it were, into commiſſion with himſelf. But when through the malice and inſinuations of falſe Apoſtles he was forced to ſpeak in his own defence, he does it with great unwillingneſs, and calls it folly and <hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of boasting,</hi> 2 Cor. xi. 1, 17. and if he <hi>muſt needs glory,</hi> he <hi>will glory in the things which concern his infirmities,</hi> 2 Cor. xi. 30. And at the ſame time he confeſſes <hi>there was given to him a thorn in the fleſh, the Meſſenger of Satan to buſſet him, leſt he ſhould be exalted above meaſure,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himſelf to be <hi>nothing,</hi> 2 Cor. xii. 5, 7, 11. He gives all the Glory to God, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying his Office, and the Grace, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled him in the adminiſtration of it: and as upon all other occaſions he ſpeaks with the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:61773:215"/>greateſt abaſement of himſelf: ſo when the importunate malice of his Enemies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained him to it, and the Glory of God and the Salvation of Men required him to ſpeak ſomething leſs ſubmiſſively of himſelf, he diſcovers his great humility in that he uſed ſo much caution, and put in ſo many leſſening and abating Clauſes, that the Glory might redound to God and not to himſelf: inſomuch that it appears to have been one of the greateſt inſtances of the Humiliation and ſelf-denial of ſo truly humble and holy a man, to be forced to ſpeak things which might ſeem boaſting, and make him incur the cenſure of Pride and Folly. But he was willing to be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vain and proud for the ſake of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and had ſo far mortified all pride and vain Glory, as to be contented upon ſo juſt an account, to incur the diſgrace of being ſuppoſed guilty of it. For there can be no higher inſtance of a truly humble and pious mind, than to forego the eſteem and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of being thought ſo, when the Glory of God and Charity to the Souls of Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it; he is not throughly humble, who in ſuch a caſe would not be thought proud, but his very Humility is matter of pride to him, and it is the laſt degree of vanity, which an humble Man can part with, to be deſirous not to be eſteemed proud. The Truth is, if it were not for the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:61773:216"/>pride of Men, there would be no need of greater caution and reſervedneſs, when we ſpeak of our ſelves, than when we ſpeak of others, but men would ſpeak the truth of themſelves and others with the ſame free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and plainneſs. So that this was an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible argument of the integrity and ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Apoſtles, that they ſpoke always what was proper and ſeaſonable to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the praiſe or diſpraiſe of themſelves, or others was not their buſineſs, but the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God and the good of Men.</p>
                        <p>They write no Encomiums upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor upon their Maſter himſelf, and they write no invectives upon their worſt Enemies, <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> but ſet down plain Truth and Matter of Fact, whoever is concerned, with the ſame ſimplicity, with which they tell their own faults.</p>
                        <p>What qualifications then can be deſired in any witneſs, which do not all concur in the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts? The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſhew by their Writings, that they were Men of underſtanding ſufficient to apprehend the things they atteſt and write about, and indeed, what Man of any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is not capable of witneſſing that to be true, which he ſees and hears, and perceives with every ſenſe? They had all the advantages and opportunities that ever any witneſſes could have, to know
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:61773:216"/>what they ſaid to be true; and they were plain men without Art or Diſguiſe, bred up moſt of them to mean and laborious Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and they had no expectations of any thing but ſufferings in this Life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were as far from any Temptation as from any poſſibility of impoſing upon the World, and they ſet down their own faults upon all occaſions as particularly, as they do whatever elſe they relate, having no regard to any thing but Truth.</p>

The Miracles wrought by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were according to an expreſs promiſe of Chriſt to them, that after his Aſcenſion they ſhould do even greater Works than he had done himſelf, <hi>John</hi> xiv. 12. that is, they ſhould do works that would be more eminent and obſervable in the eyes of the World, though not more excellent and divine; for nothing could be greater in that ſenſe than to raiſe a man from the dead. Which promiſe was fulfilled to them at the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> when men from all parts of the world were made wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to it. For they were commanded by our Saviour not to <hi>depart from Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, but to wait for this promiſe,</hi> and he aſſured them, that they ſhould be <hi>baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days</hi> after his being taken up from them into Heaven, and that they ſhould <hi>receive power after that the Holy Ghoſt was come upon them, and ſhould be witneſſes unto him both in Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the Earth,</hi> Acts i. 4, 5, 8.

                        <p>I have already ſhewn that the Apoſtles were effectually qualified to be witneſſes of what they delivered concerning Chriſt, and that they could neither be deceived themſelves in it, nor could propoſe any advantage to themſelves by deceiving o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and that if they had deſigned any deceit, they alledged ſuch circumſtances as made it impoſſible for them to have paſt undiſcovered. All which will be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly confirmed by conſidering the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Gifts, which the Apoſtles received by the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this promiſe of our Saviour. I ſhall therefore ſhew how the Apoſtles were enabled by the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt upon them to become witneſſes to Chriſt. 1. By the Miracles which they wrought themſelves. 2. By that power which was conveyed by them to others of working Miracles. 3. By their ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reſolution, Courage, and Patience under their ſufferings.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. The Apoſtles were enabled to become witneſſes to Chriſt, by the Miracles which they wrought themſelves. This power of Miracles qualified them moſt effectually to be witneſſes of the Reſurrection and Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and other Articles of our Faith: for they could neither deceive nor be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:61773:219"/>in theſe miraculous Gifts, which were beſtowed upon them, to be an aſſurance to themſelves, and an evidence to others, that it was the Cauſe of God in which they were engaged, and his truth which they delivered.</p>
                        <p>They could not be deceived them ſelves undoubtedly in a thing of this nature, they could not be ignorant, whether they were real Miracles, which they wrought or not; they muſt needs know whether their own pretences were true or falſe; and whether they could ſpeak the Languages, and do the Wonders, which the world believed them to do and ſpeak; and they could not but know by what power and means they were enabled to perform all their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Works.</p>
                        <p>And theſe works were of that nature, and done in that manner, that they could impoſe upon no man by them; they could not make men believe that they ſpoke all kinds of Languages, if they did not ſpeak them, nor that they cured all ſorts of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, if they had not cured them: nothing is more eaſy than for a man to know a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage that he underſtands, when he hears it, or than for men that were ſick to know that they are recovered, when they feel themſelves well.

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:61773:219"/>the time and place, and the perſons on whom they were wrought.</p>
                        <p>Our Saviour had been crucified at the Feaſt of the Paſſover in the ſight of the Jews and Proſelytes, who were met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from all parts of the World at that Solemnity: and but fifty days after at the next ſolemn Feſtival of the Jews, in the very ſame City where he had been Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, in the preſence of multitudes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all Nations and Languages, which came to keep the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> the Apoſtles declared to them in all their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tongues, that this ſame Jeſus was by the Almighty Power of God raiſed from the dead, and that they were impowered by him to ſpeak all thoſe Languages. The Apoſtles were at the ſame time taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of to be <hi>Gallileans,</hi> men of low Birth and of new Education. St. <hi>John</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular was known to the High Prieſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the reſt were all known to many that heard them; their Parentage, and place of Abode, and manner of Life might eaſily be enquired into: for they were no ſtrangers, nor in a far Country: and from all theſe it appeared that it was impoſſible that they ſhould be capable of ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe Languages but by inſpiration, and to ſpeak all Languages, is a thing which no man ever could hope to arrive at by ſtudy or converſation, though he
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:61773:220"/>ſhould make it the whole buſineſs of his Life: and therefore this could leaſt of all be ſuſpected of men of mean Employments, and who got their Livelihood by their daily labour and induſtry.</p>
                        <p>The Miracles which the Apoſtles wrought were likewiſe in the moſt publick places of the City, and in the moſt publick manner, upon perſons who had been moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and generally taken notice of for their Infirmities. St. <hi>Peter,</hi> by pronouncing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe words, <hi>In the name of Jeſus Chriſt of Nazareth riſe up and walk,</hi> cured a man of above forty years of Age, who was known to have been lame from his Birth, and was carried and laid daily at one of the Gates of the Temple, where there was wont to be the greateſt reſort of people, to ask an Alms of them, that entred into the Temple; and this man being immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately cured, went with St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> into the Temple, <hi>and all the people ſaw him walking and praiſing God, and they knew that it was he, which ſat for Alms at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple,</hi> Acts iii. 9, 10. And the Rulers of the Jews en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into the matter, and upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>when they ſaw the boldneſs of Peter and John, and perceived that they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned and ignorant men, they marvelled, and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jeſus, and beholding the man which
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:61773:220"/>was healed ſtanding with them, they could ſay nothing againſt it,</hi> but confeſſed among themſelves, <hi>that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them, is manifeſt to all them that dwell in Jeruſalem, and we cannot deny it,</hi> Acts iv. 13, 14, 16.</p>
                        <p>By this and other evident and publick Miracles the miraculous Power of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles became ſo much admired and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the people, that <hi>they brought forth the ſick into the Streets, and laid them on Beds and Couches that at the leaſt the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Peter paſſing by, might over-ſhadow ſome of them. There came alſo a multitude out of the Cities round about unto Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, bringing ſick Folks, and them which were vexed with unclean ſpirits, and they were healed every one,</hi> Acts v. 15, 16. And in this manner the Apoſtles continued ſeveral years in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> doing Miracles upon all occaſions, and before all people. And the ſame miraculous power manifeſted it ſelf at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where <hi>God wrought ſpecial Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles by the hands of Paul, ſo that from his Body were brought unto the Sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diſeaſes departed from them, and the evil ſpirits went out of them,</hi> Acts xix. 11, 12. So impoſſible was it for the Apoſtles to deceive thoſe, before whom their Miracles were ſo frequently and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly wrought. And yet it muſt be much more impoſſible, if any thing more impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:61773:221"/>can be ſuppoſed to deceive thoſe, upon whom their Miracles had the effect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring to them the uſe of their feet, their ſight, and their health, and even of raiſing them again from the dead.</p>
                        <p>And indeed none of the Adverſaries of old of the Chriſtian Religion ever denied, but that Miracles were wrought by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; they only diſputed the Power, by which they were wrought; they never queſtioned the reality of the Miracles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The Books of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which gave an account of theſe wondrous works, were written ſoon after the things related had been done, and theſe Books were in the hands of Heathens and Jews as well as Chriſtians; and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Jews nor the Heathens could deny but that ſuch works had been done, they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cavilled at the Power and Authority, by which they were wrought, which, how groundleſs and unreaſonable ſoever it were, yet was the only evaſion they could have, when there were ſo many Chriſtians, if they had denied the matter of fact, who did the like Miracles every day to confute them. For,</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The Apoſtles not only wrought Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles themſelves, but conveyed to others a power of working them. Thus when St. <hi>Peter</hi> was ſent for to <hi>Cornelius, the Holy Ghoſt fell on all them which heard the word,</hi>
                           <pb n="337" facs="tcp:61773:221"/>and they <hi>ſpake with Tongues, and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God,</hi> Act. x. 44, 46. And ſo at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt came on thoſe whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> had laid his hands upon, and <hi>they ſpake with Tongues and Propheſied,</hi> Acts xix. 6. And this miraculous Power was in that evident manner received by the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of the hands of the Apoſtles, that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> offered them Money to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it, <hi>Acts</hi> viii. 18. Now as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles could neither be deceived themſelves in the Miracles which they did, nor deceive thoſe, before whom they were performed, and upon whom they were wrought; ſo certainly they could never deceive ſuch as they conferred this Gift upon. When they not only did all ſorts of Miracles, and ſpoke all Languages themſelves, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed a Power likewiſe upon others of ſpeaking and doing, as themſelves did, this was ſtill a further evidence that all their pretences were real beyond all poſſibility of Deceit.</p>
                        <p>Deceivers would never have done their Miracles ſo openly, and ſo frequently, at ſuch a time and place; they would never have pretended to a gift of Tongues at a Feſtival, where men from all parts of the world were met together; ſo that they could attempt to ſpeak in no ſtrange Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but ſome preſent would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered them, if they had not been able
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:61773:222"/>to ſpeak it. But they would leaſt of all have pretended to enable others in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, to work the ſame wonders, and ſpeak the ſame Tongues, only by laying their hands upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Men that would attempt all this, though they were unable to perform it, muſt be ſo far from being capable of diſcourſing and writing as the Apoſtles did, that they muſt be void even of common ſenſe: and if they could ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in their deſigns, and make the world believe that they did act and ſpeak in this manner, when they did not, they muſt have a Power over the underſtandings and ſenſes of all with whom they converſed; which is as ſtrange even as this Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Power it ſelf. They muſt work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles either upon the objects of ſence, or upon the ſences themſelves: for in this caſe they could never have been able ſo much as to deceive without a Miracle; and ſince God would never have empowered them to work Miracles to deceive, we are certain that their Miracles were all wrought for that intent and purpoſe, which they made profeſſion of, and to confirm that Doctrine which they taught.</p>
                        <p>And this Power of Miracles, which now deſcended from Heaven upon the Apoſtles, and was conveyed by them to others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ſome Ages in the Church, and approved it ſelf to the worſt Enemies of
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:61773:222"/>our Religion in ſuch inſtances, as muſt make them moſt concerned to examine it.

                        <p>And indeed the Oracles in all parts of the World ſoon began to fail, ſo as they had been never known to do before: for their Power began to abate and decay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the approach of our Saviours Birth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, till by degrees they quite ceaſed, which the Heathens wondered at, and were much perplext about it, as we learn from what
<note n="(f)" place="margin">Cicer. de Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. Plutarch. de Oracul. Defecta.</note> they have left writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon that ſubject. And though <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate uſed all the ways that he could think of, to bring them into credit again, he was never able to elect it, but
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:61773:223"/>the moſt famous of them confeſs'd to him, when he conſulted it, that a miraculous and Divine Power reſiding in the Remains of a Chriſtian Martyr after his Death, would ſuffer no anſwer to be given. And it is ſo remarkable, that I muſt mention it once more, that when the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Emperor, in hatred and deſpight to the Chriſtian Religion, became a great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of the Jews, and encouraged them to re-build their Temple, great balls of fire broke forth under the foundation, and deſtroyed both the work it ſelf and the perſons employed in it.

The Judgments alſo which befell ſeveral of the greateſt Perſecutors of the Chriſtian Religion, were ſo miraculous and ſo terrible, as to extort a confeſſion from ſome of them of God's Juſtice in their Puniſhment, and to force them to re-call their perſecuting Edicts and change them for others in favour of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.

How can we compel all Nations to forſake the worſhip of the Gods of their ſeveral Countries, and to obſerve all things whatſoever we are commanded to teach them? With what force of Eloquence are we fitted for ſuch a deſign? What hope can we have to ſucceed in an attempt to ſet up Laws in oppoſition to the Laws e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed for ſo many Ages in behalf of their own Gods?

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:61773:225"/>the Father, which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ye have heard of me,</hi> Acts i. 4. And when the Holy Ghoſt was come, they were endued by him with a courage and reſolution almoſt as wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as the Miracles they wrought, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perform the great work which lay before them: they were not in the leaſt daunted at any dangers, or torments, or deaths, but went on courageouſly in their Duty, by the power and aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, by whom they were enabled to bring the world to the obedience of the Goſpel of Chriſt: They oppoſed themſelves to all the aſſaults of Men and Devils: Nothing could now diſcourage them, who before were ſo timorous and unbelieving, the coming of the Holy Ghoſt down upon them, wrought a mighty change in them, who were to work as great an alteration in all the world beſides. St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſtanding with the Eleven <hi>lift up his voice,</hi> he ſpoke with wonderful Reſolution, and the reſt ſtood by to bear witneſs to the Truth of what he ſaid.

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:61773:226"/>of the truth of what he delivered.

And in the third Chapter, <hi>The God of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, of Iſaac, and of Jacob, the God of our Fathers hath glorified his Son Jeſus, whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the preſence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.

And before the Council, <hi>O ye Rulers of the People and Elders of Iſrael, if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole; be it known to you all, and to all the people of Iſrael, that by the name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raiſed from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.

                        <p>And the ſame conſtancy and greatneſs of mind appeared in St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and the reſt of the Diſciples; which yet was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with equal humility and meekneſs. <hi>Whether it be right in the ſight of God to hearken unto you, more then unto God, judge ye: for we cannot but ſpeak the things which we have ſeen and heard,</hi> Acts iv. 19, 20. You may do your pleaſure, but we muſt do our duty. Nothing of fury and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, nor of wildneſs and extravagancy, but a conſtant compoſedneſs and gravity,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:61773:227"/>and a rational ſober zeal appeared in all their behaviour. They told a plain truth, and then wrought Miracles to confirm it, and afterwards ſuffered any torments ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they would renounce it, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſt from Preaching it. Though they could cure all Diſeaſes, and diſpoſſeſs Devils, and raiſe men from the dead, or take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Lives with a word ſpeaking, as in the caſe of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira;</hi> yet they were not exempted from ſufferings, becauſe we muſt then have wanted one great argument for the confirmation of our Faith. And the Goſpel was to be founded upon principles of Love and Goodneſs, not of Fear and Aſtoniſhment; and there is ſomething in the ſufferings of good men, which is apt mightily to work upon the affections, and upon any ſeeds of good nature in us: and therefore when by their Miracles they had raiſed the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Beholders, and convinced them of the Power by which they were wrought, their patience under ſufferings not only confirmed them in the truth of Religion, but laid the foundations of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Life, in gaining upon the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and affections, and in calming the ſpirits, and preparing them by ſo great examples of patience to endure all the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities incident to men. Who is there, that is not more affected with the meek
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:61773:228"/>and humble courage, and invincible pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Apoſtles, than with all the great Acts of the mighty conquerours and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers of Mankind? A few, poor, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, defenceleſs men ſtand before armed Multitudes, and ſpeak with as much Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as if all the Power of the world were in their hands; and indeed all power was in their hands, in as much as he aſſiſted and inſpired them, who is above all. They ſpeak to Multitudes with as much freedom as to one man, and to all Nations with as much eaſe, as to one people.</p>
                        <p>And the ſame Holy Spirit, who deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the reſt of the Apoſtles on the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> deſcended upon St. <hi>Paul</hi> at his converſion, and gave that great Apoſtle ſo much confidence and reſolution, ſo much pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and zeal under his ſufferings which were ſo ſevere and terrible, that we can ſcarce read them with ſo little horror, as he underwent them.</p>
                        <p>Thus did the Holy Ghoſt fit and prepare the Apoſtles to be witneſſes to Chriſt by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring them with all that courage and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which was neceſſary for men, that were to declare an ungrateful and deſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed truth amongſt thoſe, who would think themſelves ſo much concerned to oppoſe and ſuppreſs it. If they had wrought no Miracles, their courage and reſolution might have paſs'd for a groundleſs confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:61773:228"/>and if they had not had the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to ſtand ſo reſolutely to the truth of what they delivered, their Miracles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves might have become ſuſpected; but acting by a Divine Power, and being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in all their ſufferings by a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſtancy and greatneſs of Mind, and being ſo ſuddenly changed and raiſed above themſelves in all they did or ſuffered, and working the ſame change in others; they gave all the evidence and certainty of the truth of the Doctrines they taught, that it was poſſible for men to give.</p>
                        <p>And as a power of working Miracles was derived from the Apoſtles down upon their Diſciples, ſo was the ſpirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and patience under afflictions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to them. And it is obſervable, that God was pleaſed not to raiſe up any Chriſtian Emperor, till above three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after Chriſt, that he might ſhew that the Religion which came from heaven, could need no human aid nor be ſuppreſs'd by any human force; and that he might recommend the great vertues of meekneſs and patience to the world by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples men as eminent for theſe, as for the Miracles they wrought, and might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct mankind in a ſuffering Religion. For to aſſure the world of the truth of it, he would not grant it protection from Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Emperors, till moſt of the Empire was
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:61773:229"/>become Chriſtian, and Chriſtianity had diffuſed it ſelf into all the known parts of the Earth. For before the laſt Perſecution, begun by <hi>Diocleſian,</hi>
                           <note n="(l)" place="margin">Euſeb. Hiſt. lib. viii. c. 1.</note> the Church flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as much, and had the favour of the Court, and of great men, in as high a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree almoſt, as under <hi>Conſtantine</hi> himſelf; till their Proſperity cauſed their ſins, and theſe brought Perſecution. But at laſt the perſecuting Emperors were forced by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power, manifeſted in miraculous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes inflicted on them, to reſtore the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to their former liberty, in their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God; that ſo it might appear to all the world, that the Chriſtian Religion needed no Patronage of men; for God would compel its worſt Enemies to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come its Protectors, when he ſaw it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. And
<note n="(m)" place="margin">So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zom. lib. v. c. 16.</note> when <hi>Julian</hi> made it his great aim and buſineſs to reſtore Paganiſm again in the world, he ſaw, to his grief, how ineffectual all his endeavours proved; he obſerved that the Chriſtian Religion ſtill retained a general eſteem and approbation, and that the Wives and Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of his own Prieſts themſelves were moſt of them Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p>If any one then, upon a ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all circumſtances, can withſtand the conviction of ſo great evidence; I would only ask him, whether he believes any Hiſtory, or relation of matters of fact,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:61773:229"/>which he never ſaw, and deſire him to ſhew what degrees of certainty he can diſcern in any of them, which are are not to be found here: and beſides to conſider, that if in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ſubtile Age, a Doctrine ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to fleſh and blood, by ſo weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent means, could obtain ſo univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amongſt men of all Tempers, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, and Intereſts, in all Nations of the world, againſt ſo violent oppoſition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of Miracles; this is as great a Miracle as can be conceived: either there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Chriſtian Religion was propagated by Miracles, or it was not; if it was, then the Miracles, by which it was propagated, prove it to be from God; if it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by Miracles, the Propagation it ſelf is a Miracle, and ſufficient to prove it to be from him.</p>

                        <p>IT is juſtly eſteemed a ſufficient reaſon for the credibility of any Hiſtory, if it be written by men of Integrity, men who have no ſuſpicion upon them of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty, and have no Temptation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and who relate nothing, but of their own Times and within their own knowledge, though the Authors never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered any loſs, nor run any hazard in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting what they deliver. But the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt has this further advantage, that many of the moſt conſiderable things in it were done in the ſight of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and that which is an Hiſtory to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Ages, was rather an Appeal to that Age, whether the things related were true, or not.</p>
                        <p>The Hiſtory of our Saviour's Life and Death, and Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion, as it hath been proved, was atteſted by his Apoſtles, to the faces of his very Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifiers; and they all remained upon the place, where what they witneſſed had been done, for ſeveral years afterwards, declaring and preaching to all people, the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:61773:230"/>things which they had ſeen and heard. And ſoon after his Aſcenſion, when all the proceedings againſt him were freſh in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, they committed the ſame to writing in <hi>Greek,</hi> which was the moſt common language, and generally known at that time. St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> who firſt penned his Goſpel, is ſaid to have written it in <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Syriack,</hi> (tho it was ſoon after tranſlated into <hi>Greek</hi>) ſo that whover of the <hi>Jews</hi> did not underſtand the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue, might read the Goſpel in their own Language. Not long after the other Goſpels were penned, and they were all in a ſhort time diſperſed into the ſeveral parts of the world, and tranſlated into all Languages. It is particularly related,

                        <p>The Evangeliſts give ſuch an account both of the Birth and Death of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, as muſt ſuppoſe them recorded at <hi>Rome.</hi> For there the cenſual Tables were kept, where, by St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s account, the name of our Saviour muſt have been regiſtered; and his Death and Reſurrection were ſo remarkable, as they relate them, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtom uſed in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces, the Emperor muſt have a relation ſent him of them, and (as I have ſhewn) both <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> appeal to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

The memory of the Maſſacre of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants by <hi>Herod</hi> is preſerved to us by a ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> concerning <hi>Herod</hi> upon it

That the wiſe men came from the Eaſt at the ſight of the

If they had not been true, thouſands muſt have been able to contradict them, and diſcover the ſalſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of them. When matters of fact are related, with ſo many manifeſt and publick circumſtances, it is an appeal to the world for the Truth of what is written; and no man of common ſenſe would contrive a falſe ſtory with ſuch publick circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as that every Reader may be able to diſprove it. If any man ſhould affirm, that in ſuch a City or Village in <hi>England,</hi> at the command of ſuch a King, and at ſuch a time, within our memory, all the Infants, from two years old and under, were murthered, he muſt ſcarce expect to

                        <p>The darkneſs of the whole earth for three hours together in the midſt of the day, the veil of the Temple's being rent
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:61773:232"/>from the top to the bottom, the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and the rending of the Rocks, and the opening of the Graves, are things that muſt have been generally known, and could not be feigned; or if any man can be ſo vain as to imagine they might; let him but conſider, whether ſuch things could now be impoſed upon any people, by the writings of a few men, as done in the Metropolis of a Nation, at a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn time, within the memory of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands yet living, who are able to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict them from their own certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.

Would not this be the readieſt and the moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al way he could poſſibly invent, to expoſe himſelf and his Cauſe?</p>

Matt. xxvii. 8. If this field had not been ſo called, and this had not been well known at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> would any man have written in this manner?</p>
                        <p>And beſides the XII.

                        <p>The other Books of the New Teſtament are explicatory and conſequential to the Goſpel or Hiſtory of Chriſt; and beſides they contain many memorable and publick Facts, as the ſpeaking of all ſorts of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and working all kinds of Miracles at the ſolemn Feaſt of <hi>Pentecost;</hi> and the converſion of many thouſands thereby, the frequent examination of the Apoſtles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Miracles in the moſt publick pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as in the Temple, in the Streets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe are things that could not be impoſed upon the world in that very place, and in defiance of that very people, before whom they are ſaid to have been done. <hi>Gamali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite, Sergius Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Simon Magus, Felix,</hi> King <hi>Agrippa, Tertullus, Gallio,</hi> and others, were Names of too great Note and Fame to be uſed in a falſe ſtory, in which they are ſo much concerned. And all their Proceedings in
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:61773:234"/>the Courts of Judicature were kept upon record, and therefore could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tended, (without being diſcovered) by thoſe, who always had ſo many Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                        <p>The Miraculous power beſtowed upon the Apoſtles was chiefly employed in cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſeaſes, and for the health and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Mankind, but they had a power of inflicting Diſeaſes likewiſe and death it ſelf upon juſt occaſions, as in the caſe of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira, Act.</hi> v. of <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer, <hi>Acts</hi> xiii. and the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. And when this was done by private men and divulged to the world, with the names of the perſons who inflicted diſeaſes and death it ſelf, and of thoſe, on whom they were inflicted, this is an evidence both of the truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, and of the power by which it was done: for no Author could think to ſerve his Friend or his Cauſe by relating things of this nature, unleſs they had been evidently done in a miraculous manner, and by a Divine Commiſſion and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                        <p>The Converſion of St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a thing ſo memorable, both for the manner of it, and for the buſineſs he was going about, and the perſons that employed him, and for his known zeal at other times in perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Church, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> appeals to
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:61773:234"/>King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> as one, who could not be ignorant of a thing ſo notorious, <hi>Acts</hi> xxvi. 26. and it was the great providence and wiſdom of God, that a man ſo well known and eſteemed by the Phariſees and Chief Prieſts before his converſion, ſhould be the greateſt inſtrument both by his Preaching and writings for the propagation of the Goſpel; and both his Epiſtles and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Books of Holy Scripture have the ſame proof from the obſervations already mentioned, concerning the names and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of perſons, and other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

It is therefore the intereſt of every good and prudent man to wiſh the Chriſtian Religion true, though it were not ſo, and there can be no cauſe to wiſh it falſe, but our own ſin and folly. And this of it ſelf is a good argument that it is true, becauſe it is for the benefit of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that it ſhould be ſo, and upon that account it carries the viſible Characters of Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs in it: for it is certain, that the Religion, which God has eſtabliſhed in the World, muſt be of this nature, that none but wicked men can diſlike it, and that all ſober and good men muſt be well ſatisfied with it, and mightily enclined to believe it, nay even the worſt men muſt be forced to confeſs, that they owe their own ſafety and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to the Doctrines of it.

                           <pb n="368" facs="tcp:61773:238"/>ſuch is the nature of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will be evident, if we conſider that, I. It teacheth an univerſal Righteouſneſs both towards God and Man. II. It layeth down the only true Principles of Holineſs. III. It propoſeth the moſt effectual Motives. IV. It affords the greateſt helps and aſſiſtances to an Holy Life. V. It expreſſeth the greateſt compaſſion and condeſcenſion to our infirmities. VI.

The higheſt myſteries of the Chriſtian Religion are not merely ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, but have a neceſſary relation to Practice, and were revealed for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Piety and Virtue amongſt men.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. The Chriſtian Religion teacheth an Univerſal Righteouſneſs both towards God and Man. It teacheth us the nature of God, that he is a Spirit, and therefore ought to be worſhipped in Spirit and in Truth, and gives us an account of the Power and Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God in the Creation of the World, and in the various diſpenſations of his Providence in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and Government of it, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the wonderful work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. God is repreſented in the Scriptures, <hi>as ſlow to anger and great in
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:61773:238"/>Power, and who will not at all acquit the wicked,</hi> Nahum. i. 3. and we are required to love and ſerve him with all our Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties both of Body and Mind, <hi>Deut.</hi> vi. 5. <hi>Matt.</hi> xxii. 37.</p>
                        <p>The Duties of men towards one another are no leſs ſtrictly enjoyned, than our duty towards God himſelf. For the Scriptures oblige all men to the Conſcientious perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their ſeveral Duties, in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective capacities and relations. They teach Wives and Children, and Subjects and Servants, Obedience, <hi>not only for Wrath but alſo for Conſcience ſake;</hi> and they teach Princes and Husbands, and Fathers and Maſters, a proportionable care and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and affection; they check and reſtrain the rich and powerful from violence and oppreſſion, and command them to relieve thoſe that are in want, and to protect all that are in diſtreſs: and to root up the very ſeeds, and principles of Vice in us; they regulate our deſires, and give Laws to our words, and looks, and thoughts, they command an univerſal Love and Charity towards all Mankind, to hurt no body ſo much as in a Thought, but to do all the good which is in our power; they oblige men to do as they would be done unto in all caſes, to conſider others as men of the ſame nature with themſelves, and to love and reſpect them accordingly upon
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:61773:239"/>all occaſions. I may add (what <hi>Grotius</hi> has not omitted) that more favour and equity is extended to one half of humane kind by the Chriſtian Religion, than ever had been by any other: for among Infidels Women are eſteemed but as ſlaves to the Luſts of men, who may have as many Wives as they pleaſe, and change them as often as they think fit.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The Scriptures propound to us the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true Principles of Holineſs. For they teach us to perform all Duties both towards God and Man, upon Principles of Love and Charity, which are the only Principles that can make men happy in the performance of their reſpective duties, and that can cauſe them to perſevere in it. What men do upon Principles of Love they do with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and what men delight in they will be ſure to do, but fear hath torment, and men will uſe all Arts to get rid of their fears, and of that ſenſe of Duty, which proceeds only from an apprehenſion of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and therefore is perpetually griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and burthenſom to them: Rewards themſelves may become ineffectual, by propoſals of contrary Rewards: for ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler advantages, which are preſent and in hand, may be more prevalent, than never ſo much greater, which are future, and looked upon only at a diſtance. But a ſenſe of Love and Gratitude and Charity
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:61773:239"/>can never fail of its effect, becauſe this brings its reward with it, and makes our duty a delight. He who loves God will certainly obey him; and he that does not love him, never can truly obey him, as he ought, but will be ever repining at his Duty, and will be for ſeeking all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to excuſe himſelf from it. He who doth not love his Neighbour, will be for taking all opportunities of purſuing his own advantage againſt him; but he who loves him as himſelf, will never do him any injury. <hi>He that loveth another hath fulfilled the Law: For this thou ſhalt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery, thou ſhalt not kill, thou ſhalt not ſteal, thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs, thou ſhalt not covet; and if there be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this ſaying, namely, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour, therefore love is the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> Rom. xiii. 8. The Love of God and of our Neighbour comprehends the whole duty of man, which is a Doctrine no where to be met withal, but in the Holy Scriptures, all the Wiſdom of Philo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſophers could never diſcover this Doctrine, which ſets before us the only infallible prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of obedience. And it muſt be a moſt gracious and wiſe Law, which makes Love the Principle and Foundation of our whole duty both towards God and Man.</p>
                        <pb n="372" facs="tcp:61773:240"/>
                        <p n="3">III. The Chriſtian Religion propoſeth the moſt effectual motives of Obedience and Holineſs of Life. The moral Reaſons and Arguments for a vertuous Life are ſo great and evident, that thoſe who live other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, are generally convinced that they ought not to do it: but becauſe the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from Reaſon are to faint and life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, to oppoſe to ſenſe and paſſion; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Chriſtian Religion is purpoſely fitted to every faculty, and preſents us with greater objects of fear, and love, and deſire, than any thing in the world can do. And as God will be ſerved by us, upon no other <hi>Principle</hi> but that of love, ſo the chiefeſt <hi>Motive</hi> to our Obedience expreſs'd throughout the Scriptures is the Divine Love. They repreſent to us all the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods which God has been pleaſed to uſe, as neceſſary to reclaim the world by his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and his judgments, by ſending his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets <hi>at ſundry times and in divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> and at laſt by ſending his own Son. He ſaw the fondneſs that men have for this World, and for the pleaſures and ſins of it; how ſubject they are to Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and how prone to comply with them; and therefore he has been pleaſed to purſue us with the endearments of his Love, and with ſuch condeſcentions of Grace and Favour, as muſt needs migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily affect the moſt obſtinate ſinner, who
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:61773:240"/>has but the ſenſe and gratitude of a man left in him to conſider them: and then he has denounced his wrath and venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance againſt all ſuch, as will not be led and perſuaded to their own happineſs by the infinite love of Chriſt. He was born, he lived, he died for us; he has procured our pardon, he proffers us his grace and aſſiſtance, he promiſes us eternal happineſs with himſelf in heaven upon our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and laſt of all, he threatens us with eternal miſery, if we will not be happy; thus forcing us, as it were, to happineſs, if we will not be perſwaded to it: for this is all the force that free Agents are capable of. And if all that infinite Love could do to excite our Love, if all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that infinite Mercy and Goodneſs could propoſe, and the ſevereſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that Almighty Vengeance can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, will not prevail with men to follow Vertue, and refrain from Vice, nothing can poſſibly prevail with them. Love is moſt apt to produce Love, and hopes of Reward have a mighty effect upon men of any good temper and diſpoſition; but the fears of puniſhment are wont to work upon the very worſt men: and where infinite loving kindneſs, eternal Rewards, and eternal Puniſhments, do all concur to bring men to the practice of Vertue, no motive can be wanting, by which human Nature is
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:61773:241"/>capable of being wrought upon.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. The Chriſtian Religion affords the greateſt helps and aſſiſtances to an holy Life. God, who is a Spirit, and is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Being, and of the Life and Motion of all things, doth more eſpecially act upon the Spirits and Minds of Men, by putting into them good deſires, and by inclining their hearts to keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and perform his will. And this Grace and Favour of God towards us, this ſpiritual aid and ſtrength is ſufficient to enable us to conquer ſin, and over come Temptations. And we are exhorted to <hi>come boldly to the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find Grace to help in time of need,</hi> Heb. iv. 16. which we are aſſured ſhall be beſtowed upon us for Chriſt's ſake, through his Merits, and by vertue of his Mediation and Interceſſion. All the world has been ſenſible of the great proneneſs in humane nature to evil, and backwardneſs to what Reaſon it ſelf ſeems to dictate as good and fit to be done; but the Chriſtian Religion only has provided a Remedy to cure this great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our Nature, and aſſiſt us in the performance of our duty.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. The Chriſtian Religion expreſſeth the greateſt compaſſion and condeſcention to our infirmities. Chriſt died to make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for our ſins, and to procure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:61773:241"/>with God for us upon our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; he interceeds for us, and pleads the Merits of his own Death and Paſſion in our behalf, <hi>we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſins,</hi> though they be never ſo great and heinous, if we do but truly repent of them and forſake them. And the ſins of ignorance, and ſurprize, and infirmity, are not inconſiſtent with the terms of Salvation; but a general hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and repentance, with a conſtant and ſincere endeavour to ſerve and pleaſe God, will, through Chriſt's Merits, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of by him; for ſuch ſins as we have no ſufficient means or ability of knowing to be ſins, and for ſuch as by reaſon of the frailty of our Nature, we cannot live whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free from. Nothing is required of us, but a ſincere and honeſt diligence to do what we can, and a lively Faith to rely upon Chriſt's Merits, for the pardon of what ſins we are not able wholly to avoid.</p>
                        <p>Men are forward to complain of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs of the Chriſtian Yoke without any true experience and trial of it, and without conſidering the Principles and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and Helps, and the condeſcending and gracious Terms which the Goſpel propoſes. Indeed, to lay ſome injunctions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints more than are abſolutely neceſſary, is but what all Lawgivers have done. For
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:61773:242"/>ſome things are to be forbidden as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and a preſervative from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin, and others commanded as preparatory qualifications and diſpoſitions to vertue, and to make the practice of it more eaſie and certain to us. And if men are allowed in all Governments to have this Authority, certainly God, who has an abſolute Power over us, and perfectly knows what is neceſſary for our good, and for the ends of his Government, has an undeniable right to forbid or command us ſome things, which by the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we might have been allowed or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from. But theſe are very few, and all things conſidered, no Religion ever was ſo compaſſionate and eaſie as the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. The Propagation of the Goſpel has ever had great effects towards the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and happineſs of Mankind. What could be more beneficial to the world, and more for the peace and happineſs of all Mankind, than to be taught to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a perpetual ſenſe and awe of the love and fear of God, and to be conſtrained to perform our ſeveral Duties to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in our reſpective capacities and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with the utmoſt fidelity and integ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and to have this enforced upon the Conſciences of Men by the hopes and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ore of a future Judgment, and an eternal
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:61773:242"/>ſtate of happineſs or miſery, as they ſhall prove obedient, or diſobedient? Theſe then muſt be acknowledged to be Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines moſt worthy of God, and the proper ſubject of a Revelation. For however, men may wiſh as to themſelves in particular, that they had not been abridged their ſinful pleaſures, yet in reſpect to the common good of Society, it muſt needs be confeſs'd by the moſt inveterate Enemies of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and by thoſe who will believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of another life, that if the Chriſtian Religion were as generally practiſed, as it is profeſſed, it would make mankind as happy as it is poſſible for men to be in this Life, through the belief and expectation of a Life to come. And as much as the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Chriſtian Religion has been neglected, it is ſo far from being a ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative notion only, that it has a real and perpetual Influence for the good of the world, even in the worſt and moſt dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Ages.</p>
                        <p>We are not at this diſtance of time eaſily made ſenſible, how great Bleſſings the Chriſtian Religion brought to mankind, in that Reformation which it ſoon introduced into the world. For upon their Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there became ſuch a viſible alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Tempers and Lives of men, that they ſeemed to have changed their very Natures, and to be born again, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:61773:243"/>new Creatures; from whence Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is ſtiled Regeneration. This the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologiſts generally inſiſt upon, that the Converts to Chriſtianity became quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, and practiſed all kinds of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue with incredible zeal, though they had been never ſo vicious and profligate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The Chriſtians are repreſented as an innocent, devout and charitable ſort of men by <hi>Pliny, Lucian,</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate himſelf;
<note place="margin">Plin. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. ad Trajan. lib. 10. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. 97. Lucian de Morte Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrini. Julian E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. 44.</note> by thoſe who had moſt narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enquired into their Doctrines and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, and were worſt affected to them. And by theſe means the Chriſtians became as ſo many Lights in the world, to guide and direct others in the ways of Vertue: for by their example and doctrine they ſoon reformed even the Heathen world to a great degree. Morality was taught by the Philoſophers in much greater perfection than ever it had been before; and they became ſo much aſhamed of the groſsneſs of their Idolatrous worſhip, that they ſought out all arts to refine and excuſe it. And thoſe vices, which made up ſo great a part of their Idolatrous Myſteries appeared too abominable to paſs any longer for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The Oracles ſoon ceaſed, and the ſeducing Spirits confeſſed, that they were hindred from giving out their Anſwers by the Power of Chriſt, and all that <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate could do, was ineffectual to
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:61773:243"/>bring the Heathen Oracles into reputation again. Theſe are things before inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo notorious in Hiſtory, that they cannot be denied to be ſolely owing to the Power and Influence of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall mention but one inſtance more, and that is, the barbarous cruelty of the Heathen Religions, which the Goſpel has delivered the world from. For they were wont to offer up innocent Men and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in ſacrifice to their falſe Gods, and that frequently, and in ſome places daily, and in times of great danger, and upon extraordinary occaſions, they ſacrificed ſo great numbers of men at once, that it would be incredible if we had not the Authority of the beſt Hiſtorians for the truth of it. And this cuſtom of ſacrificing men to their Gods, prevailed not only here in <hi>Britain,</hi> and in other Countrys, which were accounted barbarous, but all over <hi>Greece,</hi> and in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. It may well ſeem ſtrange to us now, that ſuch a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice ſhould ſo generally prevail in the world, yet nothing is more certain from all Hiſtory, than that it did prevail, and that men were with difficulty brought off from it. For when Mankind was thus cruelly tyrannized over by bloody Daemons no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the omnipotent mercy of God could reſcue them. And <hi>for this purpoſe
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:61773:244"/>the Son of God was manifeſted that he might destroy the works of the Devil,</hi> 1 John iii. 8. which he ſoon did, Beaſts and Idols were no longer worſhipped, and men were no longer made Sacrifices, when once Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity began to appear in its full power and efficacy in the world. The plain and humble Doctrine of him that was laid in a Manger, and died upon a Croſs, was in a ſhort time more effectual to reform Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, than all the Precepts of Philoſophers, and the Wiſdom and Power of Lawgivers had ever been.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe Enemies to their own Souls, who are ſo fond of little cavils againſt the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as if they were reſolved not to be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, yet owe the happineſs of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Life in great meaſure to its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: they would not have been ſo ſafe in their Bodies and Eſtates, nay, perhaps they might have been ſacrificed to ſome cruel Daemon long before this, if that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which they reſolve to deſpiſe, but will not be at the pains to underſtand, had not been believed by wiſer and better men. Of ſo great advantage has the Goſpel been to thoſe, who will not be reclaimed and converted by it, it has deſtroyed the works of the Devil, and has diſpoſſeſt him of that Tyranny, which he held over mankind; it has made the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted world leſs vicious, and has baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:61773:244"/>all the profeſs'd Patrons and Deities of wickedneſs from amongſt men; it has made Idolatry leſs practiſed, and reduced it to narrower bounds, confining it to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter parts of the Earth: and every where upon the firſt approach of the Goſpel; the evil Spirits are diſarmed of their power, and flee away before it, as we learn from the Hiſtory of <hi>Lapland,</hi> and other Countries. So general a Bleſſing is the Goſpel of Chriſt, that even unbelievers are the better for it in this world, tho they exclude themſelves from the benefit of it in the next And the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is the only Religion againſt which the common objection concerning the prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Education in favour of it cannot be urged: for as it firſt prevailed in the world by conquering all the prejudices of Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo it ſtill maintains it ſelf againſt all the oppoſition that corrupt nature and a vicious Education can make to it.</p>
                        <p>Indeed it may ſeem a needleſs thing to have been thus large in the proof the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leney of the practical Doctrine contained in the Scriptures; when God knows this is the greateſt exception, that moſt men have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; and if the precepts were not ſo ſtrict and holy, but they might be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to live in their ſins, half the evidence we have for the Authority of the Scriptures would ſatisfy them.</p>

                        <p n="7">VII. The higheſt Myſteries of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion are not merely ſpeculative, but have a neceſſary relation to practice for the advancement of Piety and Vertue amongſt men. As there is nothing in the practical Duties taught and enjoyned by the Scriptures, but what is moſt excellent and worthy of God, and which has raiſed and improved the Nature of man beyond what could have been attained to without it: ſo the ſpeculative Doctrines have as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Characters of the Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God. They all tend to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of our Nature to make us bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, more wiſe and more happy; and are not deſigned to gratify a vain and uſeleſs curioſity, but to excite in us the Love of God, and a care and concernment for our own happineſs. They ſet before us the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal and Creation of all things, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence in which man was firſt created, and God's love and compaſſion to him after his Fall, how the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt are concerned in our Redemption, that the Father ſent his Son, that the Son was born, that he lived a deſpiſed and perſecuted Life, and at laſt underwent for us a moſt ſhameful and grievous death; that he roſe again and aſcended into Heaven, and there conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually interceeds for us, and that he ſent the Holy Ghoſt, the Comforter, who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:61773:245"/>and aſſiſts us under all temptations and dangers in our way thither, and will, if we be not wanting to our ſelves, ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conduct us to Heaven, there to reign with Chriſt in Eternal Bliſs and Glory both of Body and Soul, but if we will be diſobedient and obſtinate to our own ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, we muſt be eternally tormented with the Devil and his Angels.</p>
                        <p>The Apoſtles, who without Learning or Philoſophy, taught the moſt ſublime and uſeful Truths more plainly than the wiſeſt Philoſophers ever had done, muſt derive their knowledge from a higher Principle than they did. It is impoſſible for the wit of man to contrive any thing ſo admirably fitted to procure the happineſs of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as their Doctrines are; no precepts can be more righteous and holy, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more excellent, nor puniſhments more formidable, than thoſe of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and which is above all, no Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beſides ever afforded, nor could all the reaſon of Mankind ever have found out, ſuch powerful Motives to the Love of God, which is the only true principle of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Our Religion contains no dry and empty ſpeculations, but all its Myſteries are Myſteries of Love and Mercy: Others may fear God, but it is the Chriſtian only that can truly love him, and truſt in him, and in all conditions, in Life and in
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:61773:246"/>death look up to him, as his Father, his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and Comforter. This Religion places men in the preſence of God, and entitles them to his peculiar favour and care; it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares God to be their Friend and Protector here, and their everlaſting Rewarder after Death; it promiſes and aſſures us of all the happineſs both in Body and Soul, that we are capable of: which is the utmoſt that can be expected, or wiſhed for from any Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and the proper and peculiar reaſon, why God ſhould eſtabliſh Religion in the World.</p>
                        <p>It appears from this whole diſcourſe, that nothing is wanting in the Books of the Old and New Teſtament, which can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any Revelation. They are of the greateſt Antiquity; and have been Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed throughout the World; and have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant evidence both by Prophecies and Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, of their Divine Authority, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine contained in them is ſuch, as God muſt be ſuppoſed to reveal Mankind, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing viſible Characters in it of the Divine Goodneſs and Holineſs, and having exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly conduced to the reformation of the world.</p>

                        <p>THe Propagation of the ſeveral Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons profeſt among the Heathens has been very inconſiderable. For they were never extant in Books to be publickly read and examined, but their Myſteries were kept ſecret and concealed from the world; and all the knowledge the people had of them was from the Prieſts. Every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try had its peculiar Deities and ways of Worſhip, which were ſeldom received or known, but in thoſe places where they were firſt ſet up. The

                           <hi>Romans</hi> rejected many foreign Religions as abominable; and none of their Religions ever prevailed, but where they had the temporal Power to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them. And they loſt ground daily by the propagation of the Goſpel, whilſt the greateſt part of the Empire made it their buſineſs to oppreſs it, and to maintain the Heathen Religions againſt it.</p>
                        <p>It is to be obſerved, that the Chriſtian Religion is at this day Preached in all parts of the Heathen world, and has been ever ſince its firſt propagation, as the Jewiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was before: but where Chriſtianity

But if we examine the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Religions of the Heathens, there is no compariſon; and the only thing here to be enquired into is, whether any particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Heathens exceed or equal the Chriſtian Religion in point of Promulgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for who ever can imagine, that all, or any great number of the Heathen Religions are of Divine Revelation, muſt ſuppoſe God to reveal contradictions. The Queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, is not whether Heathens are more numerous than Chriſtians, but whether any of their Religions has been as fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged as the Chriſtian: One Herald is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to promulge a Law to many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; the City of <hi>Nineve</hi> was converted by one Prophet, and there is, perhaps, no Nation in the world but has more Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in it, than the firſt Preachers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel were.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>IT cannot be denied by any man, who is not reſolved to reject the Authority of all Hiſtory, but that many wonders have been done by Magicians, and that many things have been foreſhown and foretold among Heathens by Dreams and Prodigies, and Oracles, which did actually come to paſs: but then all that can be gathered from hence is, that there are inviſible Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and that Devils and wicked Spirits are able to do more than men can do, and to know more than men can know: for which reaſon in former Ages there was no more doubt made, whether there be Spirits, than whether there be men in the world; for they were continually ſenſible of the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Effects of inviſible Beings, which made them exceedingly prone to Idolatry, but not enclined to Atheiſm. And the caſe is the ſame now in Heathen Countries, where Apparitions and Deluſions of evil Spirits, are affirmed by all Writers to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequent.</p>
                        <p>But if at any time evil Spirits, by their ſubtilty and experience, and knowledge of
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:61773:252"/>affairs in the World, did foretel things which accordingly came to paſs, they were things that happened not long after, and commonly ſuch as themſelves did excite and prompt Men to: Thus when the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy againſt <hi>Caeſar</hi> was come juſt to be put in Execution, and the Devil had his Agents concerned in it, he could foretel the time and place of his Death. But it had been foretold to <hi>Pompey, Craſſus,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before, as
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Tull. de Divin. lib. ii.</note> 
                           <hi>Tully</hi> informs us, from his own knowledge, that they ſhould all die in their Beds, and in an honourable old Age. Some Oracles might poſſibly take their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers from the Scriptures, as that of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Hammon</hi> concerning <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, if it were not meerly a piece of flattery, which proved true by chance. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Spirits might likewiſe be able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Men, at a great diſtance, of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, the ſame day they were won, as it is related
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Ib.</note> of ſeveral, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of the Conqueſt of <hi>Perſeus</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> by <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> when <hi>P. Vatienus,</hi> to whom this was diſcovered the ſame day, was Impriſoned, till the News of the Victory was confirmed, and then he was rewarded with an Eſtate, ſettled upon him by the Senate. But they could not foretel things that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon the choice of free Agents, and which were not to be fulfilled till
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:61773:253"/>many hundred years after the prediction; this is peculiar to God himſelf, who would never ſuffer the World to be impoſed upon by Oracles of this nature, if it had been poſſible for the Devil to give them out. And though their predictions of future events did ſometimes prove true, yet they very often failed, for which no reaſon can be given, but the want of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or Power in the evil Spirits and the over-ruling Providence of God to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point and diſcover the Deluſions. <hi>He frustrateth the Tokens of the Liars, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Diviners mad; he turneth Wiſemen back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and maketh their knowledge fooliſh,</hi> Iſa. xliv. 25.

<note n="(f)" place="margin">Cic de Divin. Plut. de defect. Oraculo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> Heathen upon great Enquiries, to find out what reaſon could be given why they ſhould fail. The ceſſation of Oracles was not all at once, but by degrees, as the ceſſation likewiſe of true Prophecies and Miracles was, which were to oppoſe and aboliſh them. Their falſe and ambiguous Anſwers had brought them into contempt before, as we learn from <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly de Divin. lib.</hi> ii. in many places; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Revelation of the Goſpel their Power was ſtill leſs, and they every day became more deſpicable; and then they were upheld chiefly by human Artifice and Impoſture, till they were wholly ſubdued and decryed.</p>

                        <p>The Devil could not always foretel what was to come to paſs, and therefore his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents had need of their Vaults and hollow Statues, and other Artifices, to conceal their ignorance, and help them out, when their Arts of Conjuration failed. But we have no reaſon to think that the Devil, who is ſo induſtrious to promote his evil ends, by all poſſible means, would omit ſuch an opportunity as was given him by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion which the Heathen had of their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.

<pb n="401" facs="tcp:61773:256"/>either were indeed true, or could not be diſcerned to be falſe, but by the Doctrines and Practices which they were brought to countenance and eſtabliſh. There is no doubt but that evil Spirits may be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude and impoſe upon men, and to do many things by their ſagacity and cunning, which may be above the power of man not only to perform, but to underſtand or find out: but their Miracles were never wrought to confirm any ſound and uſeful Doctrine, nor had they been plainly foretold by ancient Prophecies, as the Miracles of our Saviour and his Apoſtles had been. And the power by which our Religion was atteſted and eſtabliſhed was ſo much ſuperiour to any power in the Heathen Gods, that when they were adjured by Chriſtians, they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to confeſs themſelves to be wicked and ſeducing Spirits, as the Primitive Chriſtians declare in their writings, and appeal to the Heathens of their own times for the truth of it, and undertake upon pain of death to prove it before them.

Notwithſtanding it is ſo much againſt humane Nature, as well as contrary to the Divine Mercy and Goodneſs, yet it made up ſo great a part of the Heathen Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and was become ſo cuſtomary, that it was hard to bring men off from it; which at the ſame time demonſtates both how falſe ſuch Religions were, and that men had a moſt undoubted experience of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Powers, or elſe in ſo many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons both the Kings and People would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have ſacrificed their own Children to their falſe Gods, to avert the evils which they were threatned withal.</p>
                        <p>The Perſons that introduced the Heathen Religions, were either Men of Deſign, who eſtabliſhed themſelves in their Power and Authority by it, as <hi>Numa,</hi> or Men of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Fiction, as the Poets, whom <hi>Plato</hi> would have baniſhed out of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:61773:261"/>And the Gods of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, who muſt be ſuppoſed to reveal theſe Myſteries and Ways of Worſhip, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways more wicked than their Votaries, whoſe greateſt Immoralities conſiſted in the Worſhip of them: the groſs Enormities not only of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> but of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> are too well known to need any particular relation.</p>
                        <p>There was no Body of Laws, or Rules of good Life, propoſed by their Oracles; but on the contrary, they were in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of laſcivions Poets, or they flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Tyrants, or they appointed Divine Worſhip to be paid to ſuch as won the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery at the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games, or to Inanimate things; or they promoted ſome other ill, or vain and unprofitable deſign, as <hi>Oenomaus</hi> the Philoſopher obſerved, and proved by particular inſtances recited out of him by

                        <p>This is enough to ſhew, that the Heathen Religions could not be from God, ſince they taught the Worſhip of Idols and of Devils; and the Myſteries and Rites of them were utterly inconſiſtent with the Goodneſs and Purity of Almighty God. And whoever doth but look into the Religions at this day
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:61773:262"/>amongſt the Idolatrous <hi>Indians,</hi> by their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous and cruel. Penances, and other Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, (beſides the ſacrificing of Men, and ſometimes of themſelves, as the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who offer themſelves to be burnt with the Bodies of their dead Husbands, and the like) will ſoon be convinced that they cannot be of God's Inſtitution. The <hi>Chineſes</hi> themſelves, who have ſo great a Reputation for Wiſdom, are like the reſt, both in their Idolatries, and in many of their Opinions and Practices.</p>
                        <p>It is evident therefore, that none of the Heathen Religions can make any probable claim to Divine Revelation, having none of the Requiſites to ſuch a Revelation, but being but of a late Original, not far divulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſupported neither by Prophecies nor Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles from God, and containing Doctrines that are Idolatrous, Impure, Cruel, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way wicked and abſurd.</p>

                        <p>BUT beſides the Religions of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, divers of the Philoſopherss pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſomething Supernatural, as <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras, Socrates,</hi> and ſome others, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will be proper here to examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likewiſe the Juſtice of their Pretenſions. And indeed, whatever the Original of the Heathen Philoſophy were, whether from their Gods, or from themſelves, if the Precepts of Philoſophy amongſt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens were a ſufficient Rule of good Life, there may ſeem to have been little or no neceſſity for a Divine Revelation. But I ſhall prove, 1. That the Heathen Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy was very defective and erroneous. 2. That whatever was excellent in it, was owing to the Revelations contained in the Scriptures. 3. That if it had been as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and as certain, as it can be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be, yet there had been great need of a Divine Revelation.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Heathen Philoſophy was very defective and erroneous. It was <hi>deſective</hi> in point of Authority. <hi>Socrates,</hi> though he would be thought to be inſpired, or ſupernaturally aſſiſted, gave Men only his own word for it. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> indeed, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:61773:263"/>both to Prophecies and Miracles, but he was a great Magician, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion both of

                           <hi>Xenophon</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and therefore whatever he did or foretold, muſt be aſcribed to that Power, which, as it has been before declared, the Devils may have, to do ſtrange things, and to know things done at a diſtance, or ſome time after; and his Predictions and Miracles, (even as they are related by <hi>Jamblichus</hi>) were ſuch, as that a bare recital of them were enough to confute any Authority, which could be claimed by them. His Impoſtures may be ſeen in <hi>Diogenes Laer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi> And

                           <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſays, <hi>Epimenides</hi> foretold nothing, whatever others relate of him. And as the Philoſophers had no <hi>Divine</hi> Authority for what they deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo their <hi>own</hi> was but of ſmall account; they were generally rather Men of Wit and Humour, than of ſound Doctrine or good Morals. And whoever reads the Lives of the Philoſophers written by <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes Laertius,</hi> and the Lives of the <hi>Caeſars</hi> by <hi>Suetonius,</hi> would believe the World might have been as ſoon reformed by the one as the other. As to the Philoſophers, who after the Chriſtian Religion appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the World, pretended to Miracles, it is a hard matter to think the Writers of their Lives in earneſt, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them: For a Man may as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:61773:263"/>the Fables of <hi>Aeſop</hi> or <hi>Lucian</hi> to be true Hiſtory, as the Stories in the Life of <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus</hi> written by <hi>Philoſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> or thoſe in the Life of <hi>Iſidorus</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Damaſcius,</hi> an abſtract whereof we have left preſerved

                        <p>The Heathen Philoſophy was defective likewiſe in point of Antiquity and Promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Philoſophy, as far as we have any account of it, was but a late thing; ſo it is ſtyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Tully

                        <p>That philoſophy was defective in its Doctrines is notorious: For, as <hi>Lactanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> obſerves, the very Name of philoſophy (invented by <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who yet would be thought to have had ſome ſupernatural aſſiſtance) implies a confeſſion of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,

                           <hi>Pythagoras</hi> gave this very reaſon why he ſtyled himſelf a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, Becauſe no Man can be Wiſe but God only, and yet this vain Man ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pretended himſelf to be a God. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> was the firſt of all the Philoſophers that applied himſelf to the ſtudy of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality; and
<note n="(*)" place="margin">Tull. Acad.

So that, as <hi>Tully</hi> ſays, <hi>Arceſilas</hi> was not the Founder of a new Academy, or Sect of Philoſophers, who profeſſed to doubt of all things, for he taught no more than what the ancient Philoſophers had ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally taught before him, unleſs it were that <hi>Socrates</hi> profeſs'd to know his own ignorance of things, but <hi>Arceſilas</hi> would not own himſelf certain of ſo much as that. Indeed the notions of Philoſophy were ſo little convincing, even in the plaineſt matters, that many of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:61773:264"/>Wits took up in Sceptiſcim, or little better. No man had ſtudied all the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes of Philoſophy more, or underſtood them better, or had better explained them than <hi>Tully,</hi> and yet at laſt all concluded in uncertainty, as he often profeſſes: the like may be ſaid of <hi>Varro, Cotta,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                        <p>The Doctrine of Philoſophy concerning God and Providence, and a Future State, was very imperfect and uncertain, as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> himſelf declared juſt before his death: but what could be certain to him, that profeſt to doubt of every thing;

                        <p n="2">II. Whatever there is of excellency in the Philoſophy of the Heathens is owing to Revelation. It is generally ſuppoſed, that humane Reaſon could have diſcovered the more common and obvious Precepts of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, contained in the Scriptures; but it is more probable, that it could not have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered moſt of them, if we may judge by the groſs abſurdities, which we find as to ſome particulars, in the beſt Syſtems of Heathen Philoſophy, and from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral practice of offering up men for ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to their Gods, and of caſting away and expoſing their Children in the moſt civilized Nations. But it is evident from what has been already proved at large, that the Heathens were not left deſtitute of many helps and advantages from the Scriptures, which divers of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers had read: and many things, which ſeem now to be deductions from natural Reaſon might have their Original from Revelation: for things once diſcovered ſeem eaſie and obvious to men, which they would never have been able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover of themſelves. We wonder now, how men ſhould ever ſuppoſe there could be no Antipodes, and are apt to admire how <hi>America</hi> could lie ſo long concealed,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:61773:270"/>rather than how it came at laſt to be diſcovered: and the caſe is the ſame in many other Diſcoveries, eſpecially in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Truths, which are ſo agreeable to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that they may ſeem the natural Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of it, though a contrary cuſtom and inclination, and the ſubtlety of Satan working upon our depraved Nature might perhaps have made it very difficult, if not impoſſible, without a Revelation, to diſcern many Doctrines even of Morality, which now are moſt common and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to us: What Maxim is more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and therefore, as one would think, more obvious to humane Reaſon, than that every man ſhould do to others, as he would have them do to him? And yet <hi>Spartianas</hi> an Heathen Hiſtorian ſays, that <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> had this excellent rule of natural Juſtice and Equity either from the Jews or Chriſtians. There is no Book of Scripture which ſeems to contain plainer and more obvious things, than the Proverbs of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and
<note n="(x)" place="margin">Ld.

<pb n="425" facs="tcp:61773:270"/>No man can tell, how far humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could have proceeded without Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſince it never was without it, but always argued from thoſe Principles, which were at firſt delivered by God himſelf to <hi>Noah,</hi> and were propagated amongſt his Poſterity throughout all Ages and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though they were more corrupted and depraved in ſome Ages and Nations than in others.</p>

Antoninus, Maximus Tyrius,</hi> and others.</p>
                        <p>We may therefore reaſonably conclude that the Precepts and Rules of Morality, which Philoſophers all along taught, had their original from Revelation, rather than from the ſtrength and ſagacity of their own reaſon; becauſe they err in things no leſs obvious to natural reaſon, and it appears that they had opportunities of becoming acquainted with the Scriptures, and that they ſpared no pains either by reading or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:61773:272"/>in their own, or in foreign Countries, in their ſearch and enquiries after truth.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. If the Heathen Philoſophy had been as certain and excellent, as it can be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be, yet there had been great need of a Divine Revelation. For, 1. The rules of Philoſophy lie ſcattered up and down in large and learned works, mixt with many wrong and abſurd notions, and therefore muſt be in great meaſure uſeleſs; how cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and excellent ſoever they may be in themſelves, they can be no rule of Life to us. No perfect rule of Manners is to be found in any one Author; and if it were poſſible to compile ſuch a rule out of them all, yet what man is able to collect them?
<note n="(m)" place="margin">Lact. de vit. Beat c. 7.</note> 
                           <hi>Lanctantius</hi> is of opinion, that if all the truths diſperſed up and down among the ſeveral Sects of Philoſophers could be collected together into one Syſtem, they would make up a Body of Philoſophy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Chriſtian Doctrine, but then he concludes it to be impoſſible for any man to make ſuch a collection, without a ſupernatural Aſſiſtance. And if there were no other reaſon for it but this, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that we find
<note n="(n)" place="margin">Tull. de Orat. lib. i.</note> the XII Tables pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all the Writings of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers. If there be nothing ſo abſurd, as <hi>Tully</hi> ſays, but the Philoſophers have taught it, then it is neceſſary that men
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:61773:273"/>ſhould not be left to the uncertainties and abſurdities of Philoſophy: for tho ſome few of them might be free from ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies, yet their Notions were no Rule or Standard to the reſt, and the beſt were not without many great Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Rules of Philoſophy were no better than good Advice, and carried no Authority with them to oblige men in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; they had not the force of a Law, and failing in this neceſſary point, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their intrinſick worth had been, they never could have had that effect upon the Lives of men, which Revealed Religion has. Vertue was propounded by Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers rather as a matter of Honor and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, than of ſtrict Duty; thoſe were eſteemed and admired indeed that obſerved it, but ſuch as did not, only wanted that commendation. Some Philoſophers ſpoke great and excellent things, but they paſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for wiſe ſayings, than for Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: their own Reputation, which was greater or leſs with different ſorts of men, was the only Authority they had: it might be prudence to do as they taught, but there appeared no abſolute neceſſity for it. They commonly repreſented Vertue as very lovely, with many very great and powerful charms, and all that were of another mind, did not know a true Beauty, and that was
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:61773:273"/>an intolerable diſgrace: the Sanction of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments in the next Life was little inſiſted upon by them. They recommended Vertue for it's own ſake, not as it is enjoyed by God, and will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by him, and the contrary puniſhed; and thoſe, who could not ſoar to their Heights, were rather the worſe than the better for ſuch Doctrines, which they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as the impracticable ſpeculations of ſome, who had a mind to ſpeak great things. And they often ſpoke the Truth indeed, which they had from Tradition, or from the excellency of their own Wit and Genius, but they were not able to make it out by any ſuch Principles, as are wont to influence and govern humane Actions. Accordingly we find, that as the ſeveral Sects of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy ſuited to the Tempers and Humors of particular men, ſo far they prevailed, and no farther. The curious and inquiſitive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themſelves, to the Academicks, the ſoft and effeminate to the Epicureans, and the Moroſe to the Stoicks; men applyed themſelves to what ever opinion they liked beſt, and found moſt agreeable to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Diſpoſition. Thus a ſevere and haughty Gravity made up the Compoſition of <hi>Cato;</hi> it had been hard for him to avoid the being a Stoick, and he might probably have founded that Sect, if it had not been known in the World before. The Philoſophers
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:61773:274"/>had no Authority to promiſe rewards or to threaten puniſhments upon the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation or neglect of their Precepts, and therefore every man was at his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to chuſe or to reject what they taught, and divers of them were ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this unavoidable defect in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Doctrines, and therefore pretended to Revelation.</p>
                        <p>There is no inconvenience therefore in ſuppoſing, that many of the Precepts contained in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and other Books of Scripture might be known without a Revelation: for there is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding very good Reaſon, why they ſhould be inſerted into the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Becauſe the Scriptures have the Authority of a Divine Law, and are to be looked upon, not as a Syſtem of Ethicks, or a Collection of Moral Precepts, but as a Body of Laws given out upon Divers occaſions and as Rules of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which at the ſame time both ſhew us our Duty, and command our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. It is not expected that Kings in their Laws ſhouid argue more profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than other men do, but they ſhould command more effectually than others can teach; they do not diſpute, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and dictate, what their ſubjects muſt take notice of at their peril. And it is no diminution to a Princes Authority
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:61773:274"/>to command the moſt known and obvious things, though it may be a fault in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to need ſuch commands. And God in his word did not deſign to furniſh us with a Treatiſe of Philoſophy, to gratify our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, with ſtrange and new notions, and make us profound Scholars; but to ſpeak to the neceſſities of men, and put them in mind of known Duties, to appeal to their own Conſciences, and to enforce thoſe notions of Good and Evil, which natural reaſon perhaps might ſuggeſt to them, by the authority of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion, and a Divine Law, eſtabliſhed upon Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Though the Philoſophers were able to diſcern ſomething more than other men, yet they durſt not openly declare what they knew, but were over-born with the errors and vices the Times and Countries in which they lived, even to the Commiſſion of Idolatry, and the worſt of vices, and therefore their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines whatever they were, could do but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good towards the reformation of the World. I ſhall not enquire into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports concerning <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato, Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> himſelf, but only obſerve that <hi>Socrates,</hi> who was the only Martyr among the Philoſophers, for the truth, yet when he comes to die, ſpeaks with no aſſurance
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:61773:275"/>of a Future State, and ordered a Cock to be ſacrificed to <hi>Aeſoulapius,</hi> which can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be reconciled to that Doctrine, for for which he is ſuppoſed to die. And after his Death, how did his Friends and Diſciples behave themſelves? Did they openly and courageouſly vindicate his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, and teach the Doctrine for which he ſuffered? Did they not uſe all means to conceal and diſſemble it? But Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſtood in need of a perfect example of Virtue, and of ſuch inſtructors, as ſhould both teach and practiſe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of it at their utmoſt peril, and of a ſucceſſion of ſuch Men, as ſhould bear Teſtimony to their Doctrine, both by the Miracles wrought during their Lives, and by the conſtancy of their Deaths.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. As the Heathen Philoſophy wanted the Authority of a Law, and the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of thoſe who taught it; ſo it wanted principal Motives to recommend the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it to the Lives of Men. The Philoſophers teach nothing of the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love of God towards us; of his deſire of our happineſs, and his readineſs to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and conduct us in the ways of Virtue. They owned no ſuch thing as Divine Grace and Aſſiſtance towards the attainment of Vertue, and the perſeverance in it.—

For though the Alcoran has been tranſlated into moſt of the Languages in uſe amongſt Chriſtians, yet it has never been known to make any Proſelytes, but by force of Arms. At firſt this Religion had many circumſtances for its advantage, which might, in humane probability, gain it ſucceſs in the world. It was begun in Rebellion, and in a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Revolt from the Emperor <hi>Heraclius,</hi> and beſides this popular and ſeducing Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Licence and Violence, <hi>Mahomet</hi> added the enticements of Luſt and Senſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality; he forbad Men indeed ſome things, but ſuch as he could eaſily ſee they would part with for the free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded enjoyment of others: then he pretended to ſound his Doctrine on the Authority of <hi>Moſes</hi> and of Chriſt, ſaying
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:61773:276"/>that Chriſt had promiſed to ſend him; all which made his Religion find the more eaſy entertainment amongſt both Jews and Chriſtians. 'Twas but like the Hereſy of the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> at the firſt, and not altogether ſo groſs, and this muſt needs encline all of Seditious and lewd principles to come in to him, being glad of ſuch a colour for their wickedneſs; and it had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Power and Force to make it more laſting, than other ſuch Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have been.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt on the contrary forbad Reſiſtance of the ſupreme Power upon any terms whatſoever; he aſſerted the Authority of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but ſo, as to aboliſh the ceremonial part of the Law, which was what the Jews were moſt fond of: ſo that this very thing made the Jews the moſt implacable enemies of Chriſtianity, and brought Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to contempt among the Heathen: for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could make the Goſpel of leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in their eſteem, than to deduce its Authority from the Books of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It can be no great wonder to ſee men drawn into thoſe vices under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Religion, which no Laws nor Puniſhments can reſtrain them from; but for a Religion that forbids all vice under the ſevereſt penalties, to prevail in a
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:61773:277"/>vicious world is truly miraculous. Beſides, it is Death, by the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Alcoran, men are forbid all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and diſcourſe about Religion, they are charged to believe none but <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> and to look upon all others as unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all manner of converſation.

                        <p>But nothwithſtanding all theſe complian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with the Luſts and Paſſions of men, if we take in all Ages ſince the Incarnation of Chriſt, the Chriſtian Religion (not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Jewiſh) has had a much larger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation than ever Mahometaniſm has had; and has at all times been taught in more parts of the world, and even amongſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans themſelves. And the Alcoran it ſelf aſſerting the Divine Authority and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion both of <hi>Moſes</hi> and Chriſt, ſerves in ſome meaſure to propagate the Faith of the Old and New Teſtament; ſo far, I mean, as to give an advantage and opportunity for men to make enquiry into them, and become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them.</p>

                        <p>The Scriptures are defective in nothing that is requiſite in a Divine Revelation, but have all that can be required in the higheſt degree; to inſtance here only in Miracles, and in thoſe only of our Saviour and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. Our Saviour wrought his Miracles in the midſt of his Enemies, and extorted a Confeſſion from the Devils themſelves of his Divine Power. And if the Apoſtles had not been well aſſured, and abſolutely certain of his Reſurrection, they would never have had the confidence, and the folly, (for it could have been no leſs) to maintain ſo ſoon after his Death, in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> the City where he was Crucify'd, that he was riſen from the Dead; they would never have choſen that, above all places, to Preach this Doctrine, and work their Miracles in, if they had not been true: at leaſt, they would never have done it, at the great and ſolemn Feaſt of Pentecoſt, to provoke the <hi>Jews</hi> to expoſe them to all the World for Impoſtors; no, they would have taken time to have laid their deſign with ſome better appearance and contrivance: to be ſure, they would have avoided <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as much as they could, and, above all times, at ſo ſolemn a Feſtival as that of Pentecoſt, they would have gone rather to the remoteſt corners of the Earth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But when they ſtood the Teſt of all that the <hi>Jews</hi> could ſay or do to them; when in that very City, where he had been ſo lately Crucify'd, they told the <hi>Jews</hi> to their face, and before that numerous concourſe of People, which was then met together at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that they were Murtherers, that they murther'd their Meſſias, but that he was riſen from the Dead, and that by vertue of his Reſurrection they ſpoke thoſe Languages, and did thoſe Works, which they then ſaw and heard. This was plain and open dealing, and there could be no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in it; if any thing of this could have been diſproved they had been for ever ſilenced, but their worſt enemies were ſo far from being able to diſprove what they ſaid, that about three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Converts were made on the day of Pentecoſt.</p>
                        <p>The innocent and Divine Life of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, the holineſs and excellency of his Doctrine, the ſimplicity, and meekneſs, and conſtancy of his Diſciples, the continuance of Miracles for ſeveral Ages in the Church, the wonderful Propagation of the Goſpel by a few, poor, ignorant, deſpiſed, and perſecuted Men, every paſſage, every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, in the whole diſpenſation of the Goſpel, is full of evidence in proof of it. But thus much in this place ſhall ſuffice, all
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:61773:283"/>particulars having been largely inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their proper places.</p>
                        <p>And ſince, as ſure as there is a God, there muſt be a Revealed Religion; if any Man will diſpute the Truth of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, let him inſtance in any other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that can make a better Plea, and has more certainty that it came from God; let him produce any other Religion that has more viſible Characters of Divinity in it, and we will not ſcruple to be of it; but if it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to ſhew any ſuch, (as has been proved) then he ought to be of this, ſince there muſt be ſome Revealed Religion; and if that Religion which has more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for it than any other Religion can be pretended to have, and all that it could be requiſite for it to have, ſuppoſing it true, and which it is therefore impoſſible to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be falſe if it were ſo.

                        </head>
                        <p>HAving proved the Truth and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of our Religion, I ſhall in the laſt place, upon theſe Principles, give a Reſolution of our Faith, which is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that has cauſed ſuch unneceſſary and unhappy Diſputes amongſt Chriſtians in theſe latter Ages; for in the Primitive Times, this was no matter of Controverſie, as indeed it could not then, and ought not now to be.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Conſidering the Scriptures only as an Hiſtory, containing the Actions and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and of our Saviour and his Apoſtles, we have the greateſt humane Teſtimony, that can be, of men, who had all the opportunities of knowing the truth of thoſe Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which gave Evidence and Authority to the Doctrines, as Revealed from God, and who could have no Intereſt to deceive
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:61773:284"/>others, but expoſed themſelves to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dangers, and infamy and torments, by bearing Teſtimony to the Truth of what is contained in the Scriptures; whereas Impoſtures are wont to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, not to incur ſuch ſufferings, but to avoid them, or to obtain the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and pleaſures of this world. And ſo this Teſtimony amounts to a moral certainty, or, as it is properly enough cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by ſome, to a moral infallibility, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it implies a moral impoſſibility of our being deceived by it: ſuch a certainty it is, as that nothing with any reaſon can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt it. We can have as little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did, and ſuffered, and taught, what the Scriptures relate of them, in <hi>Jeruſalem, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, &amp;c.</hi> as that there ever were ſuch places in the world; nay, we have that much better atteſted than this, for many men have died in Teſtimony of the Truth of it.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. This Teſtimony being conſidered with reſpect to the nature of the thing teſtified, as it concerns eternal Salvation, which is of the greateſt concernment to all mankind, it appears that Gods Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Goodneſs are engaged, that we ſhould not be deceived inevitably in a matter of this conſequence: So that this Moral Infallibility becomes hereby Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:61773:284"/>Infallibility: and that which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but Humane Faith becomes Divine, being grounded not upon Humane Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, but upon the Divine Attributes, which do atteſt and confirm that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Teſtimony; and ſo Divine Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is the ultimate ground, why I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the will of God to be delivered in the Scriptures; it is no particular revealed Teſtimony indeed, but that which is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to it, <hi>viz.</hi> the conſtant Atteſtation of God by his Providence. For it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the very notion of a God, to let men be deceived, without any poſſible help or remedy, in a matter of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. And ſo we have the ground of our Faith abſolutely Infallible, becauſe it is evident from the Divine Attributes, that God doth confirm this Humane Teſtimony by his own.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. The Argument then proceeds thus: If the Scriptures were falſe, it would be impoſſible to diſcover them to be ſo, and it is inconſiſtent with the Truth and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Almighty God to ſuffer a deceit of this nature to paſs upon mankind, without any poſſibility of a diſcovery; therefore it follows, that they are not falſe. Here is, 1. The object, or thing to be believed, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Revelation delivered to us in the Scripture is from God. 2. The
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:61773:285"/>Motive or Evidence to induce our Belief, <hi>viz.</hi> Humane Teſtimony. 3. A confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Teſtimony, or the Formal Principle and Reaſon of our Belief, <hi>viz.</hi> the Divine Goodneſs and Truth. The object therefore, or thing believed is the ſame to us, that it was to thoſe who ſaw the miracles by which the Scriptures ſtand confirmed, <hi>viz.</hi> the revealed Will of God: and the Ground and Foundation of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is the ſame that theirs was, <hi>viz.</hi> the Divine Goodneſs and Truth, whereby we are aſſured, that God would not ſuffer Miracles to be wrought in his own Name, according to Prophecies formerly deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and with all other circumſtances of credibility, only to confirm a Lye. The only difference then between the reſolution of Faith in us, and in the Chriſtians who were Converted by the Apoſtles themſelves is this, that tho we believe the ſame things, and upon the ſame grounds and reaſons with them, yet we have not the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate motives or evidence to induce our Belief; or to ſatisfie us in theſe reaſons, and convince us, that the Revealed Will of God, contained in the Scriptures, is to be believed upon theſe grounds; that is, to ſatisfie and convince us that the belief of the Scriptures being the Word of God is finally reſolved into the Authority of
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:61773:285"/>God himſelf, and is as well certified to us, as his Divine Attributes can render it. For they were aſſured of this, from what their own ſenſes received, but we have our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of it from the Teſtimony of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                        <p>The Queſtion therefore will be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the motives and arguments for this Belief in us, or the means whereby we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come aſſured, that the Revealed Will of God is contained in the Scriptures, be not as ſufficient to produce a Divine Faith in us, and to eſtabliſh our Faith upon the Divine Authority, as the motives and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which thoſe had, who lived with the Apoſtles, and ſaw their Miracles, could be to produce that Faith in them, which reſolved it ſelf into the Divine Authority. And this enquiry will depend upon theſe two things: 1. Whether we may not be aſſured of ſome things as certainly from the Teſtimony of others, as from our own Senſes. 2. Whether this be not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe, relating to the reſolution of Faith. I ſhall therefore conſider in the firſt place the certainty which we have for the matters of fact, by which the Authority of the Scriptures is proved and confirmed to us, compared with the evidence of ſence, and will then apply it to the reſolution of Faith.</p>
                        <pb n="456" facs="tcp:61773:286"/>
                        <p n="1">I. In many caſes men ſeem generally agreed, that there is as much cauſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what they know from others, as what they ſee and experience themſelves. For there may be ſuch circumſtances of credibility, as equal the evidence even of ſence it ſelf; no evidence can ſatisfie ſence ſo much indeed, nor perhaps ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the paſſions, as that of ſence; but there may be other evidence, which may give as clear conviction, and altogether as good ſatisfaction to our Reaſon, as that which is immediately derived from our ſences, concerning the Being of Objects, or the Truth of matters of fact. Thus thoſe who never travelled to the <hi>Indies,</hi> do as little doubt that there is ſuch a place, as thoſe who have been never ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten there; and all men believe, there was ſuch a man as <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> with as little ſcruple as if they had lived in his time, and had ſeen and ſpoke with him. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe no man in his wits makes any more doubt, but there are ſuch places as <hi>Judoea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> from the conſtant report of Hiſtorians and Travellers, than if he had been in thoſe places himſelf, and had lived the greateſt part of his Life there: and the greateſt Infidel that I know of, never pretended yet to disbelieve, that there was ſuch a perſon as our Saviour Chriſt. But all men think themſelves as
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:61773:286"/>well aſſured of things of this nature, upon the credit of others, as if they had ſeen them themſelves. For how doubtful and intricate ſoever ſome things may be, for want of Knowledge or credit in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters; yet there are other things delivered with that agreement and certainty on all hands, that to doubt of them would be as unreaſonable, as to doubt of what we our ſelves ſee and hear.</p>
                        <p>And if our Saviour's Reſurrection, for inſtance, be of this nature, we can with as little reaſon doubt of it, as if we had liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at that time, and had converſed with him after his Reſurrection from the Dead. But we have as great aſſurance that he was alive again after his Crucifixion, as that he ever lived at all; and we have at leaſt all the aſſurance that there was ſuch a Perſon as Chriſt, that we can have, that there once lived any other man at that diſtance of time from us. We can no more doubt that our Saviour was born in the Reign of <hi>Auguſtus Coeſar,</hi> and was Crucified under <hi>Tiberius,</hi> than that there were once ſuch Emperors in the World; nay, we have it much better atteſted that Chriſt was Born, and was Crucified, and roſe again, than that there ever were ſuch Princes as theſe two Emperors: for no man ever made it his buſineſs to go about the world to certifie this, and to teſtifie the truth of
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:61773:287"/>it, at his Death. But the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their Diſciples and Converts, and innumerable others ever ſince, from the beginning of Chriſtianity, have aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the particulars of the Life, and Death and Reſurrection of our Saviour, under all dangers, and torments, and deaths; and have made it their great aim and deſign, both living and dying, to bear Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to the Truth of the Goſpel. So that a man may as well doubt of any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact that ever was done before his own time, or at a great diſtance from him, as doubt of theſe fundamentals of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; and yet there is no man, but thinks himſelf as certain of ſome things at leaſt, which were done a long time ago, or a great way off, as if he had been at the doing of them himſelf.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, in ſome reſpects we ſeem to have more evidence than theſe could have, that lived in the beginning of Chriſtianity; for they could ſee but ſome Miracles, we have the benefit of all; they relyed upon their own ſences, and upon the ſences of ſuch as they knew and converſed with; we upon the ſences of innumerable People, who ſucceſſively beheld them for the ſpace of Divers hundred years together: ſo that whoever will not believe the Scriptures, <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would he believe, though one roſe from the Dead;</hi> that is, though the greateſt Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:61773:287"/>were wrought for his conviction. This was ſaid of the Old Teſtament, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may with greater reaſon be ſaid of that and the New both.</p>
                        <p>And we have beſides, one ſort of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which thoſe that lived at the firſt planting of Chriſtianity could not have; for we ſee many of thoſe Prophecies ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, which our Saviour foretold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Church; we know how it ſprung up and flouriſhed, and from what ſmall unlikely beginnings it has ſpread it ſelf into all corners of the Earth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to this day, notwithſtanding all the malice of Men and Devils to root it out and deſtroy it.

This is a ſtanding and invincible proof to us at this diſtance of time, and has the force of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Argument, the one of a Power of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, the other of Prophecies: we know that a miraculous power has been mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in conquering all oppoſition, and in a wonderful manner bringing thoſe things to paſs which to humane wiſdom and
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:61773:288"/>power are altogether impoſſible. And the fulfilling hereby of Prophecies is a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible confirmation to us of the truth of thoſe Miracles, which by the Teſtimony of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers we believe to have been done by the Prophets, whoſe Prophecies we ſee ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. And ſince it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that things may be ſo well atteſted, that we may with as much reaſon doubt of the truth of our own ſences, as of the Authority, by which we are aſſured of the truth of them, and muſt turn Scepticks or worſe, if we will not believe them; we may conclude as well upon the account of theſe Prophecies, which we our ſelves ſee fulfilled, as upon all other accounts, that the Hiſtorical evidence in proof of the Chriſtian Religion, amounts to all the certainty that a matter of Fact is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, not excepting even that of ſenſe it ſelf.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Let us now apply all this to the Reſolution of Faith, and give an account how a divine and infallible Faith may be produced in us. Humane Teſtimony is the Motive, by which we believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to contain God's revealed Will: this certifies us that ſuch Miracles were wrought, and ſuch Prophecies delivered, as give to the Scriptures the full evidence and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Divine Revelation. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be enquired, why we believe the
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:61773:288"/>Scriptures to be the word of God? the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, upon the account of the Miracles and Prophecies, which concurring with all other circumſtance requiſite in a Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, confirm the Truth of them. If it be asked, how we know that theſe Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Miracles are true and effectual, and not feigned, or inſufficient; I anſwer, becauſe we have them ſo related and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, that conſidered barely as matter of Fact, they have all the credibility that any matter of Fact is capable of, and therefore may as ſafely be relied upon, as any thing which we do our ſelves ſee, or hear. If it be further urged that for all this I may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſince all men are fallible, and no man is infallibly aſſured that there is ſuch a place as <hi>Rome,</hi> who never ſaw it; though no man neither can any more doubt of it, than he can doubt whether there be ſuch a place as <hi>London,</hi> who lives in it. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that there is a bare poſſibility of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceived in all humane evidence, but yet I deny that we can poſſibly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in this caſe, becauſe, though the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence it ſelf be humane, yet the things which it concerns are of that Nature, that God would never ſuffer the World to be thus long impoſed upon in them, without all poſſibility of finding out the Truth. So that here we reſolve our Faith into the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:61773:289"/>Authority, by reaſon of the ſame Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, by reaſon whereof the Eye witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of them did reſolve theirs into it, but they believed theſe Miracles as ſeen by themſelves, and we believed them as ſeen, and witneſſed by others, but both they and we believe them as the works of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                        <p>It might have been alledged, if we had ſeen thoſe Miracles that we might poſſibly be decived; and ſo indeed we might, if we could not have ſecurely relyed upon Gods Truth and Goodneſs, that they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by him to confirm the Doctrine, for the ſake of which they were wrought, and we may with equal ſecurity rely upon the ſame Truth and Goodneſs for the certainty of the Hiſtory of them, as we could have done for the ſufficiency of them to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for which they were wrought, tho they had been performed in our ſight, ſince it is as impoſſible to find out any deceit in the account given of them, as it would have been for us to find any in the Miracles themſelves at the time of their performance.</p>
                        <p>Humane Teſtimony is the conveyance and the means of delivering the Truths contained in the Holy Scriptures down to us; and we, who could neither ſee the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles nor hear the Doctrines at the firſt hand, have at this diſtance of time the
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:61773:289"/>truth of them aſcertained by a continued ſucceſſive Teſtimony, till we arrive at ſuch as were immediate witneſſes of them. Now thoſe that ſaw and heard all things which are delivered to us in the Scriptures, could not eſteem their ſences infallible, but they notwithſtanding believed our Saviour and his Diſciples to be ſo, of whom yet their ſenſes only could give them means of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that they were infallible. They knew their ſenſes might deceive them, (or that they might be miſtaken concerning the objects of ſence) but nevertheleſs they believed that our Saviour and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles could not deceive them, upon this only ground, that their ſences, or their reaſon by deduction from ſence told them ſo. There was not one man of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps but had often obſerved his ſenſes miſrepreſent objects to him, and yet in this caſe upon the ſole Teſtimony of their ſenſes they grounded an infallible Faith: becauſe, though their ſences had miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented objects, yet it was in a wrong medium, at an undue diſtance, or by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome indiſpoſition of the ſenſe it ſelf, and ſtill their ſences, or rather their reaſon by the help of their ſences diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that their ſences had led them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to miſtakes. But in the preſent caſe, when the Object was placed in open and frequent view, to the greateſt advantage,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:61773:290"/>when it was publick and expoſed to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, when all agreed in the ſame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion concerning it, and when the matter was of infinite importance, here they had reaſon to conclude, that the God, who fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Sences, would not ſuffer them to be ſo hurtful to them, as they muſt needs have been, if they had been deceived by them. In like manner, in the Teſtimony, which deſcends to us from former Ages, we ſee with other mens eyes, and hear with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens ears; and though the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of others may often fail us, and is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a double inconveniency, through the incapacity and unfaithfulneſs of witneſſes, yet, as in the former caſe, ſo here, when all circumſtances are weighed and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and after the utmoſt tryal, no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be found to with-hold our aſſent, but all things ſtand undiſproved, and no juſt ſcruple appears, but only a bare poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of being deceived; and this ariſing not from any defect, but that of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature it ſelf, here Gods Goodneſs and his Truth muſt needs interpoſe, to take away that only impediment, which otherwiſe muſt unavoidably hinder any thing from ever being known to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>
                        <p>The only certainty which we can have that our ſences are true, is this, That God will not ſuffer them to be deceived, where
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:61773:290"/>the diſpoſition of the medium, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Object, and all other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are rightly qualified: becauſe that would be inconſiſtent with his Attributes of Juſtice, Goodneſs and Truth; but it would be inconſiſtant with theſe Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, not upon the account of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; for they would be provided for as well, though our ſences were deluded; we ſhould ſee, and hear, and taſte juſt as we do now, though we were never ſo much deceived in theſe ſenſations: therefore the Truth, and Goodneſs, and Juſtice of God are engaged not to ſuffer us to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, in reſpect to our Souls, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to our Bodies: and if we have no certainty that our ſences do not deceive us, but becauſe God would not ſuffer ſuch a cheat to be put upon us, as we are intelligent and rational Beings; we have the ſame and much greater reaſon to conclude, that he would not ſuffer us to lye under ſuch a deluſion in reference to our eternal Intereſt. If God would not ſuffer our minds unavoidably to lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a temporal deluſion of no great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, have we not much more reaſon to conclude, that he would not ſuffer us una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably to be deceived by any means what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, in reference to our eternal Intereſt? For in this caſe, to be deceived is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and to ſuffer it, is a thouſand times

If we have nothing to object but the imperfection of human nature, we may rely upon God that this ſhall never miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead us, in a matter of ſuch conſequence, whether the imperfection be in our own ſences, or in the Teſtimony of others. In ſhort, the Miracles related in the Scriptures will as effectually prove a Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to us, as they could to thoſe that ſaw them, but the difference is, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved their ſences and we believe them, and all things conſidered, we have as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe upon their evidence, as they could have to believe upon the evidence of their ſences.</p>
                        <p>Let us conſider Hiſtory as a medium, by which theſe Miracles become known to us, and compare this medium with that of Sight. If a man would be ſceptical, he might doubt whether any medium of Sight be ſo fitly diſpoſed, as to repreſent objects in their due proportion, and proper ſhape, he might ſuſpect that any Miracles which he could ſee, were falſe, or wrought only to amuſe and deceive him, and there would be no way to ſatisfy ſuch an one, but by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him that this is inconſiſtent with the
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:61773:292"/>Truth and Goodneſs of God. So in this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther medium of Hiſtory, which to us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the want of that of Sight; a man may doubt of any matter of Fact if he Pleaſes, notwithſtanding the moſt credible evidence, but in a matter of this nature, where our Eternal Salvation is concerned, we may be ſure, God will not ſuffer Mankind to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived without all poſſibility of diſcovering the deceit. The circumſtances have all the marks of credibility in them, and therefore, if they be duely attended to, cannot but be believed, and the Doctrine which they are brought in evidence of, being propounded to be believed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under pain of Damnation, require that they ſhould be attended to, and conſidered: and that, which is in its circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances moſt credible, and in its matter is ſuppoſed neceſſary to Salvation, muſt be certainly true, unleſs God could oblige us to believe a Lye. For not to believe things credible, when attended to and known to be ſuch, is to humane nature impoſſible; and not to attend to things propoſed as from God, of neceſſity to Salvation, is a very hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Crime againſt God, and to think that God, will ſuffer me to be deceived in what I am obliged, in Honour and obedience to him, to believe upon his Authority, is to think he can oblige me to believe a Lye.

Which ſeems to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note, that a peculiar Bleſſing belongs to them, becauſe they believe upon leſs evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. I anſwer, that they are there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Bleſſed, who had ſo well conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the nature and circumſtances of things, the Prophecies concerning the Meſſias, and what our Saviour had delivered of himſelf, as to believe his Reſurrection upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of others; not becauſe others might not have as ſufficient Grounds for their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, as thoſe who ſaw him after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but the evidence of ſenſe is more plain and convincing to the generality of men, though Reaſon proceeds at leaſt upon as ſure and as undeniable Principles. A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, when it is rightly performed, is as certain, as the ſelf evident Principles upon which it proceeds, though it be ſo far removed from them, that every one cannot diſcern the connexion. Demonſtrations may be far from being eaſie and obvious, but are oftentimes, we know, very difficult and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, which yet, when they are once made out, are as certain as ſenſe it ſelf. The Bleſſing is pronounced to him, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not upon leſs evidence, But upon that which at firſt ſeems to be leſs, which is leſs obſervable, and leſs obvious to our conſideration, but not leſs certain, when it is duly conſidered. For which
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:61773:293"/>reaſon our Saviour after he had wrought many Miracles, that were effectually atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſufficient witneſſes, required Faith in thoſe, who came to be healed of him, becauſe the Teſtimony of others was the means, which in Ages to come, was to be the motive of Faith in Chriſtians, and he thereby ſignified to us, that there may be as good Grounds for Faith upon the report of others, as we could have from our own ſences, and generally thoſe who came in unbelief, went away no better ſatisfied: Wherefore it is ſaid, that in his own Country becauſe of their unbelief, <hi>he could do no mighty work, ſave that he laid his hands upon a few ſick Folk and healed them,</hi> Mark vi. 5. He could not do his mighty works, becauſe they would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, and would be loſt upon them, and he could do nothing Inſignificant or in vain; if they would reject what had been ſo fully witneſſed to them, they would not believe whatever Miracles they ſhould ſee him do.</p>
                        <p>It is very remarkable, that amidſt all his Miracles, our Saviour directs his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to the Scriptures for the Authority of his very Miracles, and that even after his Reſurrection, he inſtructs his Diſciples, who ſaw and diſcourſed with him, out of the Scriptures, to confirm them in the
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:61773:294"/>truth of it. <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 26, 27. He requires the Jews to give no greater credit to his own Miracles, than that which he implies, they already gave to the wrirings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo as firmly and ſtedfaſtly to believe that he came from God. And we having all the helps and advantages which the Jews had to create in them a Belief of the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, and many more and greater Motives (if it be poſſible) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve theſe of the New, muſt therefore have ſufficient means to excite in us, that Faith which our Saviour required of thoſe who ſaw his Works, and heard his Doctrine; which certainly was a Divine Faith, and all the Faith, which, if it be accompanied with ſincere and impartial obedience, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in order to Salvation.</p>
                        <p>Upon the whole matter I conclude, that the Truth of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is evident even to a Demonſtration: for it is as Demonſtrable that there is a God, as it is that I my ſelf am, or that there is any thing elſe in the World; becauſe nothing could be made without a Maker, or created without a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; and it is as Demonſtrable, that this God being the Author of all the perfections in men, muſt himſelf be infinitely perfect; that he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely Wiſe and Juſt, and Holy and Good, and that according to theſe
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:61773:294"/>Attributes he could not ſuffer a falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be impoſed upon the world in his own Name, with ſuch manifeſt Tokens of credibility, that no man can poſſibly diſprove it, but every one is obliged to believe it.</p>

And tho' I could have little Encouragement to hope, that I ſhould write any thing which might much prevail with Men of theſe Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; yet I was perſuaded that ſo good a Cauſe, tho' but in weak Hands, could not fail of ſome Effect upon all that would be at the pains to conſider it. And to this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I thought, the beſt way would be, not to read Lectures, as it were, of Anatomy upon the ſeveral Parts of it, and repreſent it Piece-meal, like a lifeleſs Carcaſs, divided and diſſected; tho' I had been able to ſhew never ſo much Skill in the Operation; but to give an entire View of the Grounds and Reaſons of Chriſtianity, the connexion of its Parts between themſelves and the Preference which it has to all other Religions; from
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:61773:298"/>whence, I knew, it muſt appear in as true a Light, and with as much Life and Force, as it could do under the Diſadvantages, which might be expected from no better a Pen. There is an Excellency in every Part of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſeparately conſider'd, but the ſtrength and vigour of each Part is in the Relation it has to the reſt, and the ſeveral Parts muſt be taken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, if we would have a true Knowledge, and make a juſt Eſtimate of the Whole.</p>
                  <p>But that which I made my more particular Care, and which, I thought, the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd my Pains, becauſe I had not obſerved it to be much inſiſted upon by others, was to ſhew the Neceſſity of a Divine Revelation, the inſufficiency of Natural Religion, and the Imperfections and Errors of Philoſophy, as well as the manifeſt Falſhood of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions both of the Heathens and of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans; and moreover to prove, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all other Things requiſite to a Divine Revelation, the Religion delivered in the Old and New Teſtament has received a full Promulgation in all Parts of the World. From theſe Foundations thus laid and ſecur'd, we have no leſs than a Demonſtration for the Truth of our Holy Religion.</p>
                  <p>We are often told by thoſe that are no Friends to our Religion, that we muſt by all means take great Care of not being deceived through the Prejudices derived from our Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; but I believe it would be found upon
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:61773:298"/>Enquiry, that ſuch Men are ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prejudiced in Favour of our Religion, that their Prejudices lie extreamly againſt it. For, beſides the Corruption of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture always inclining to Error and Vice, tho' they had the Principles of Chriſtianity inſtill'd into them in their tender Years, yet they could learn them then only as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Truths, to be receiv'd for Articles of Faith and Rules of Life. But the firſt thing probably to which they have ſet themſelves with any Application, was the reading of Heathen Authors, and when perhaps they have ſtudied Philoſophy and other Humane Learning for many Years, but never conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Divinity, as a Science, and have ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into it no farther, nor have any other Notion of it, than what they were taught in their Childhood or Youth, they look back upon their firſt Inſtructions as groundleſs, and fit only for Children, becauſe they find lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing of them in thoſe Authors, with whom they have been ſo long converſant, and whom upon many Accounts they have ſo juſt Reaſon to admire. This ſeems to be the Caſe of many who have read antient Heathen Authors, without the Regard, which ought always to be had to That, which is acknowledg'd by All, who have made any due Enquiry into theſe Things, to be the beſt Learning and of greateſt Antiquity, and is no where to be had but from the Scriptures.
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:61773:299"/>Others there are, who have often heard of the Names of <hi>Socrates, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and of <hi>Tully, Seneca,</hi> and other Famous Writers; they find them frequently quoted, and commonly with Commendation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeldom to diſcover any Fault in them, unleſs it be in their Notions of Natural Philoſophy, where Religion ſeems to be leſs concerned. They have heard too of the Greek and Latin Hiſtorians, and theſe, for any thing that they know or conſider, may be as Faithful and as Antient as the beſt.</p>
                  <p>But tho' all theſe Authors have indeed very many Excellencies, yet we muſt not ſo far mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, as to think all things Excellent which they deliver. I ſhall therefore, beſides what I have already obſerved, make ſome farther Reflections in this place both upon the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and upon the Philoſophy of Heathen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and then I hope I may be allowed to expoſtulate with the Adverſaries of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, concerning the Unreaſonableneſs of their Proceedings, before I come to give a ſhort Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my preſent Undertaking.</p>

<note n="(q)" place="margin">Pro Flacco.</note> Oration of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he muſt conclude, that what is ſpoken againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> is rather to their Commendation, than to their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. <hi>Tully</hi> there declares the <hi>Greeks</hi> to be of no Credit nor Eſteem, but unfaithful, and of the worſt Reputation, even to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb in their Teſtimonies and Oaths. He is careful not to involve the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemonians</hi> in the common Scandal, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for his Client, and gives a high Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the <hi>Maſſilians,</hi> and would ſeem to confine his Diſcourſe to the <hi>Aſiatick Greeks,</hi> by whoſe own Confeſſion, he ſays, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Phrygia, Myſia, Caria,</hi> and <hi>Lydia</hi> were proverbially Infamous. When he has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt this Contempt of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> he falls next upon the <hi>Jews:</hi> But what has he to ſay of them? He calls their Religion a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Superſtition, and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a Suſpicious and Railing City, and he pronounces the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion to be unſuitable to the Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and Gravity, and the Cuſtoms of the <hi>Romans;</hi> he inſinuates that they were a People not well affected to the <hi>Roman</hi> State, and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Conqueſt of them by <hi>Pompey,</hi> as an Argument againſt the Truth of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

One of the Accuſations laid againſt <hi>Flaccus,</hi> whoſe Defence <hi>Tully</hi> had undertaken, was, that Summs of Gold having been wont to be ſent out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and out of all the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces to the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem, Flaccus</hi> had forbidden any to be exported from <hi>Aſia.</hi> Here it concern'd <hi>Tully</hi> to expoſe the Worſhip of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to vindicate the Prohibition relating to it; but he, who never ſpoke little upon any Subject, that could afford a Scope for his Eloquence, ſays ſo little here to the diſpraiſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> and their Religion, that the Commendation of another had been leſs to their Honour. It is obſervable that <hi>Tully</hi> mentions nothing of their Worſhiping an Aſs, which was ſo groundleſs and fooliſh a Slander, that it is hard to imagine what could give occaſion to it, and perhaps no better Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it can be aſſigned, than that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of their Religion were reſolved to faſten the worſt and moſt ridiculous Falſhood they could upon it. But if it may be permitted me to add a Conjecture to thoſe which have been made by others; it ſeems probable, that the higheſt degree of Excommunication among the <hi>Jews</hi> being ſtyled <hi>Shammatha,</hi> which is
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:61773:304"/>the ſame with <hi>Maran Atha, Sham</hi> ſignifying <hi>Lord,</hi> as

                  <p>It would be a very wrong inference from what has been ſaid, to conclude, that there is no certainty in the Greek and Latin, and other Heathen Hiſtorians: For the Circumſtances of the Relation, and the Conſent of divers Authors, may put moſt parts of Hiſtory paſt doubt. But it ought to be conſidered, that thoſe which have been mentioned, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, to which the Sacred Hiſtorians are by no means liable; they do not charge one another with Falſhood, nothing can be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered of Partiality in their Writings, but they tell the moſt diſgraceful Truths of their Anceſtors, and of themſelves; and the Hiſtory it ſelf has ſo many publick Circumſtances, that they clear it beyond all ſuſpicion of Deceit. If the Names of ſome Men be omitted, upon particular occaſions, in the Scriptures; we find them mentioned there upon others. And there is evident Reaſon, that the Names of infamous Men ſhould in ſome Caſes be omitted, and ſhould not be inſerted in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies, and enrolled in the Regiſters of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:61773:304"/>But when the Memory of Perſons and Actions is totally ſuppreſt, this muſt extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abate the Credit of any Hiſtory. The <hi>Jews</hi> are the only People in the World, that have had their Antiquities by an uninterrupted Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition delivered down and preſerved in an Authentick Book, unanimouſly aſſerted by the whole Nation, in all Ages, which they have never changed nor altered, but have in great numbers ſacrificed their Lives in Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of it. If the Heathens in divers things contradict the Hiſtory of the <hi>Jews,</hi> they contradict one another as much in the Accounts of their own Antiquities, and what they relate of the <hi>Jews,</hi> is upon uncertain and contrary Reports. If they conceal what concerns the <hi>Jews,</hi> it was their Cuſtom to ſtifle that which did not pleaſe them. The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories as well as the Religion of moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations were kept ſecret, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the People, no Book of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry among them was ever put into the hands of a whole Nation, with a ſtrict Charge to every one to read and ſtudy it, as the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> were, when the Principal and moſt Memorable things related, were within the knowledge and Memory of all that read them. The <hi>Jews</hi> were under a neceſſity of preſerving their Genealogies, with all imaginable Care and Exactneſs, if they would make good the Claim and Title to their Inheritances, ſo that the meaneſt among them could with
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:61773:305"/>the greateſt certainty derive his Line from <hi>Adam,</hi> whereas the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings, as we learn from

                     <hi>Herodotus,</hi> could boaſt but of a ſhort Deſcent, and the Kings and Emperours of the <hi>Romans</hi> and of other Nations, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their Pedigrees were forced to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to fabulous Reports. And the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Accounts of the Original, not only of particular Families, but of the ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World, are acknowledged to be Fabulous, or, at the beſt, but very uncertain, by the moſt accurate Hiſtorians.</p>
                  <p>The Account of the Prophecies and Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles contained in the Scriptures was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be miſtaken at firſt, and it has been tranſmitted with all the certainty that any Hiſtory is capable of, to Poſterity. And the Writers of the Old and New Teſtament all agree in the Account of the Creation, of the Deluge, of <hi>Abraham</hi> and the other Patriarchs, of the Bondage of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> their Miraculous Deliverance from thence, and their Journying into the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> they all frequently aſſert, ſuppoſe or imply the Truth of theſe things; there is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Series and Line of Truth obſervable throughout the whole Scriptures. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Heathen Writers it is otherwiſe; they contradict one another in Matters of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Antiquity, if they agree in ſome material Paſſages, it is commonly with much variation in the Circumſtances, and with
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:61773:305"/>great Uncertainty and Doubtfulneſs; and the things in which they moſt agree, are ſuch as have been taken from the Scriptures, which compoſe a Book, that if it were but for the Antiquity and Learning of it, is the moſt valuable of any Book in the World, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Vice and Ignorance, and that which is the worſt ſort of Ignorance, a Pretence to Learning could make it ſo much deſpiſed.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. If the Hiſtories of Heathen Nations be ſo little to be relied upon, their Philoſophy will appear to be worthy of no more Regard, which, for any thing of Truth and Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there is to be found in it, depends ſo much upon Hiſtorical Traditions. That Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is the moſt antient way of Writing, is not only aſſerted by Heathen Authors, but may with great probability be made out from the Scripture it ſelf. Poets were the Chief upholders of the Religion and the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy in uſe among the Heathens; both theſe were at the firſt taught in ſhort Maxims, which, that they might be the better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and the more eaſily retain'd in Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, were put into Verſe, without any farther Ornament than juſt what was neceſſary to give a clear and full Expreſſion to their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Precepts.

This Sect was very numerous, and had Men of great Note in the Primitive Ages of Chriſtianity, who did not loſe the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity offer'd them of improving it. But the Philoſophers then began to carry on a Joint-Intereſt, and thoſe who denominated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from any particular Sect, were no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtrict in adhereing nicely to its Principles. For upon the preaching of the Goſpel to the World, the Philoſophers thought it concern'd them to review all that had been formerly written, to unite their Forces, and ſelect thoſe Notions out of every Sect, which were moſt plauſible, omitting ſuch as they ſaw would then give Offence: and it appears that they were greatly beholden to the Religion which they oppoſed and pretended to deſpiſe; it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that they had read the Scriptures, and do ſometimes make uſe of Terms which they had taken from thence, unknown to former Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers. But Philoſophy after all their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours ſtill retaining many Errors, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Evidence and Authority, which is the foundation of all true Religion, could never

                     <hi>Lipſius</hi>'s Friend was, to whom he wrote a long Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, to convince him that this was the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Heathen Nations, and agreeable to the Judgment of their Philoſophers: So that many of the Adverſaries of the Chriſtian Faith, may perhaps owe their Lives to that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they Blaſpheme.</p>
                  <p>I have purpoſely avoided too curious an enquiry into the lives of the Philoſophers, and rather choſe to caſt a Veil over what not only their Enemies but their Friends have ſaid of them. The Practice of Men is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally worſe than they confeſs it ought to be; they never live above their Rule and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; it is well if in moſt things, they do not fall much ſhort of it; and if their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples be Bad, what muſt we expect from their Examples? But the Actions of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:61773:312"/>concerned thoſe with whom they lived, our Buſineſs is with their Writings; and I need not fear the Cenſures of Learned and Judicious Men in any thing I have ſaid of them; for they will acknowledge it to be Truth, and others ought to be told ſo, that they be no longer willing to change the Bible for the Works of Philoſophers, which they commonly read and underſtand as little as they do the Bible it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The utmoſt that Philoſophy could reach, was no farther than to uncertain Hopes and doubtful Arguments. But our Saviour and his Apoſtles <hi>taught with Authority,</hi> and not as did the Philoſophers; <hi>The Words which they ſpake, they were Spirit, and they were Life;</hi> They came with full Power, and had their Credentials from Heaven to produce, which are the ſame that we now allege for the Authority of their Commiſſion. And what can be more certain than plain Matter of Fact, which is clearly prov'd by undeniable Circumſtances, and by Witneſſes beyond Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and which is of that Nature, that all the Divine Attributes are engag'd for the Truth of it? It is ſtrange that Men ſhould pretend to fetch their Infidelity from the Depths of Philoſophy, and the <hi>Oracles of Reaſon;</hi> as if any floating, confus'd Notions might not ſerve for objections. But it is to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a bad Cauſe, to involve it in tedious and unneceſſary Diſputes, to make Digreſſions
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:61773:312"/>into doubtful Points of Criticiſm and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, to amuſe the Reader, and draw him off from the main Queſtion: Whereas a good Cauſe may commonly be brought to a clear and ſhort Iſſue. The preſent Controverſy will admit of all kinds of Learning, but has no need of it. My Buſineſs therefore has been to free this Matter, as much as may be, from all the Intricacies of Learning, to reduce it to plain Circumſtances of Fact, whereof every man may be capable of making a true Judgment, and to bring it to that very Caſe, in which St. <hi>John</hi> argues; <hi>He that believeth not God hath made him a Lyar, becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not the Record that God gave of his Son.</hi> 1 John v. 10.</p>

                  <p>But do they not prove what they pretend? As little of that as may be; but they ſay it, and ſay it often and confidently, and perhaps ſometimes wittily, and this muſt paſs for Proof. But do Men love, or will they endure to be talk'd or jeſted out of any thing that is dear to them but their Souls? Let the Wit be what they pleaſe, or can fancy it to be, certainly they muſt be much too fond of it who can be contented to loſe not only their beſt Friend, but Heaven it ſelf for a Jeſt, which perhaps, after all, would be little taken notice of on another Subject, and has nothing to recommend it but Profaneneſs, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone which ſhould make it abhorr'd, cauſeth it to be admired.</p>

                  <p>As there is nothing ſo bad but ſome may pretend to ſpeak for it (as a Panegyrick has been written upon <hi>Buſiris,</hi> and another upon <hi>Nero</hi>) ſo nothing is ſo excellent but it may be ſpoken againſt; and if no Right or Title muſt be allowed as true or certain, which may be queſtioned or diſputed, it is hard to ſay what any Man can have that he may call his own. But let it be conſider'd that there is little Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Judgment required in advancing or maintaining new and ſtrange Doctrines, and in rejecting the old. Things may be ſo plain, as for that very Reaſon to be hard to prove, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is nothing plainer to prove them by; a bold denial of the truth of our Senſes and Faculties may ſeem to promiſe ſomething of more than ordinary ſubtilty; though there be no more in it than this, that he who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to deny the very grounds and foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all Reaſoning, has taken effectual care not to be confuted. It is a miſtake to think that it is eaſieſt to ſpeak upon a common Subject; a Man indeed can never want ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay upon ſuch a Subject, but he is prevented in what he ſhould ſay, it is known before-hand, and expected from him: The niceſt thing of all is to enforce and improve known Arguments, and to give new Life, and a better Genius, as it were, to that which has been ſaid a thouſand times before. It is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally eaſieſt to diſcourſe on the wrong ſide of a Queſtion, becauſe there never is ſo little ſcope
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:61773:314"/>for Fancy and Invention, as when a Man is confined to ſtrict Truth; Error will admit of all Extravagancies, but Truth is a ſevere and uniform thing, and there are thoſe whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Extravagancy almoſt will pleaſe, for the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of it. There may be ſome Art required to make a known Story delightful in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but News is commonly welcome, tho' it be never ſo ill told, and the moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and uſeful Creatures are little regarded, when the worſt of Monſters are the more ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at the more they be deformed. Let thoſe who make ſuch a noiſe with their Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, but change the Subject, and try how it will ſucceed with them, they will ſoon find the difference, and perceive that they will ceaſe to be in vogue, when they have no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the vanity and ill nature, and vices of Men on their ſide.</p>
                  <p>It is with our Minds in this reſpect, as it is with our Bodies, when once they are well ſupplied with all that is neceſſary or convenient, they begin to loath wholeſome Food, and to ſeek out for varieties of Luxury, and are fond of any thing that may pleaſe them to their hurt. It is thus in every Art and Science, eſpecially in ſuch as all Men think themſelves more or leſs concern'd to know. Men firſt were contented to ſpeak ſo as to be underſtood, and to expreſs their meaning plainly and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally with Truth and Simplicity to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; afterwards ſpeaking became an Art,
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:61773:315"/>and at laſt in the beſt and moſt elegant Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, it degenerated into nothing but Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation, and all the ridiculouſneſs of a falſe Eloquence. The ſame thing happened in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy; the <hi>Scepticks</hi> carried this innovating humour to the utmoſt Extravagancy, for, the Primitive Traditions being obſcured and corrupted, and every Succeſſion of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſtriving to ſet up for themſelves, and to outgo each other, they had brought it to that paſs, that <hi>Tully,</hi> who knew as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man, ſays, that nothing can be more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd than what ſome of the Philoſophers held, but the Author of the <hi>Leviathan</hi> proceeds far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and obſerves that

                     <hi>no Living Creature is ſubject to the Privilege of Abſurdity but Man only, and of Men, thoſe are of all moſt ſubject to it that profeſs Philoſophy.</hi> And if we will not believe him upon his word, he has given us his Example for it; few Men, I think, having written more extravagant things than he has done in every part of Philoſophy; if Religion were ſet aſide, he would never have eſcaped among the Philoſophers and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians of any Age; he diſputed the Principles of Geometry, as well as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of all Religion, and both with a like Succeſs. He calls <hi>Abſurdity</hi> the Privilege of Mankind, a ſtrange Privilege! which he has made the moſt of. But ſince with a little time the Novelty and Varniſh of his odd Opinions are worn off, they are not now, that I have
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:61773:315"/>perceived, ſo much regarded, but have been forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give way to other Notions which are as Bad, and have nothing more to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them, but that they are of a later Date and a newer Faſhion.</p>
                  <p>There is little Reaſon why any one ſhould value himſelf for talking againſt received Doctrins, and perſuading others to what they are already but too much inclin'd. But to reſcue Antient and deſpiſed Truths, and bring them into Reputation; to convince the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and gain the Affections of Men, to make the ſame Truths always pleaſe and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways appear with a new and amiable Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre; this is indeed a difficult Task. For a Man to cultivate the Principles of Vertue, and improve the Growth of it to make every ſubject, which he treats of to become the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him, and to thrive and flouriſh under his Hands, is an Argument of true Learning and ſubſtantial Knowledge; but there is no Skill required to make the weeds of Vice grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace; all the Art is in deſtroying them, and it is a ſign of a little Mind when one is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſtinguiſh himſelf only by Singularity, by an odd Dreſs, or a new Mode, when his Wit borders upon Madneſs and Prophaneneſs, and his Learning is all out of the way. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who are neither Heterodox in Religion, nor fond of being ſingular in any thing elſe, have ſhewn an extraordinary Sagacity, and a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing variety of excellent Learning upon Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="xxxviii" facs="tcp:61773:316"/>which are unuſual and in themſelves but little conſiderable. And I will not deny but that ſome of the Men of Singularity have no Worſe Deſign than to gratify a little Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and to appear like ſome body in the <hi>Commonwealth of Learning,</hi> as if Learning were a mere Trifle, a very Play-thing, to be employ'd to no ſerious and uſeful Purpoſe, but would ſerve only to give men occaſion to talk, and to be talk'd of. This is call'd <hi>Pedantry</hi> and I know not why that ſhould go under a better Name, which is of a worſe Nature, and join the Trifling of Pedantry to the Miſchief of Irreligion. If this Sort of Men would but buſie themſelves no worſe than <hi>Tiberius</hi> did, when he examined, who was the Mother of <hi>Hecuba;</hi> what Name <hi>Achilles</hi> went by, whilſt he hid himſelf in Womans Apparel, and what Songs thoſe were, which the <hi>Sirens</hi> were wont to ſing; thoſe indeed are profound Enquiries, and ſo worthy of them, that it were pity they ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd in ſuch ingenious Diſquiſitions. But if Men will be for removing Foundations, and rejecting eſtabliſhed Doctrines, and denying the Principles of Religion; it is fit they ſhould be told, that there is neither Wiſdom nor Learning in this; and thoſe who are acted themſelves by a Spirit of Contradiction, have the leaſt Reaſon of any Men to take it amiſs to be contradicted, tho' it be in never ſo plain a manner. In ſhort, it is poſſible that ſome
<pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:61773:316"/>may be well Skill'd in Tricks and Artifices, who know little of the ſubſtantial and uſeful Part of the Law, and it is certain that many who talk boldly of the higheſt Points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are ignorant even of <hi>the Principles of the Doctrine of Christ.</hi> There ſurely can be little need for any Man to have recourſe to Error and Extravagancy for the exerciſe and improvement of his Faculties, they muſt be ſtrange Faculties to want ſuch Improvement. Truth it ſelf is infinite, tho' always uniform and conſiſtent in every part, and will afford room enough for the free uſe of Reaſon, in examining and conſidering the Nature of things, in ſtating particular Caſes by general Rules, in the Study of Antiquity, and in explaining particular Texts of Scriptures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Analogy of Faith, and the Tenour of ſound Doctrine. And it may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be look'd upon as a Defect of Judgment and good Senſe, or be ſuſpected (which is much worſe) of want of Sincerity and a good Conſcience, when Men can find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, by which they may recommend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the World, but by ſetting up for Novelties in Religion. For what Man of an honeſt Meaning, and of ſufficient Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ſtrength of Parts, to proceed ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in direct and approved Paths, would run out of the way by Cunning and Artifice, to ſteal a deſpicable Reputation, which another would be aſham'd of, and of which the beſt
<pb n="xl" facs="tcp:61773:317"/>thing that can be ſaid, is, that, as it is never worth the having, ſo it is never laſting.</p>
                  <p>After the Reception and Eſtabliſhment of the Goſpel for ſo many Ages, we are call'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to prove the Grounds and Principles of our Religion all over again, and we will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver decline a thing ſo eaſy to be done. But the Modern Infidels have changed the State of the Queſtion: The Truth of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wrought by our Saviour and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples was never deny'd by the Adverſaries of Chriſtianity of old, this was not diſputed by <hi>Celſus, Porphyrie, Hierocles,</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate; if ſome of them did upon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion inſinuate the contrary, that was ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and groundleſs a Calumny, that they were neither able to inſiſt upon any Proof of it, nor to reconcile it to what they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had elſewhere ſaid. The Matter of Fact was acknowledged by the antient <hi>Jews,</hi> and has been confeſt by their Poſterity; they could not contradict the Miracles, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Conſequence of them: tho' the Men we have to deal withal, to make clear work, with much Confidence, but with as much Ignorance, deny both. Let them know then, that they are in part confuted by the Enemies of our Religion; and it were ſtrange if its Friends ſhould fail in the other Part.</p>

A man may very well be guided in the right Road without having all the wrong and dangerous Paths deſcrib'd to him; and he may be directed how to recover or preſerve his Health without being preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Catalogue of Diſeaſes; he may get ſafe to his Journeys end, without knowing all the Bogs and Precipices by which he might have miſcarried; and in order to be well, there is no need that he ſhould be acquainted how many ways there are of being ſick. I have heard of ſome that read Objections without the Anſwers; as lately a ſhameleſs Writer has produced the Objections of <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> againſt the Canon of Scripture, without take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Notice of the Anſwers given by <hi>Origen</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> from whom he had them. And tho' both the Objections and Anſwers ſhould be read; yet Objections are commonly in few Words, and are often remembred, when the
<pb n="xlii" facs="tcp:61773:318"/>Anſwers are forgotten. And indeed, tho' I were never ſo Expert at it, I have no Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to try my ſtrength in tying a knot, that I may ſhew my Skill in unlooſing it. But to provide againſt all exceptions, as much as it is poſſible, I have proved at large, that if all Objections could not be anſwered, this would be no ſufficient Reaſon to reject or queſtion the Authority of our Religion.</p>
                  <p>I cannot ſay I muſt confeſs, that I have been able, or have been much ſollicitous to obviate all the Cavils which may have been ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, many have been given up, and others ſeem never to have been ſeriouſly urged. An Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor who had more Learning it ſeems, than Judgment to ſpare, wrote a Book to prove that there were Men before <hi>Adam;</hi> but this was rejected by Judicious Men as a very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and Ridiculous Conceit, particularly by <hi>Grotius,</hi> as the Author complains, who yet afterwards retracted it himſelf. Some not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding are ſo fond of any Parodox that they are ſtill for maintaining it. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it agrees admirably with a Tradition of the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> that their Anceſtors were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Moon, and if any Man ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that this might very well be true, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Carteſian Hypotheſis,</hi> by attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting to prove that <hi>Arcadia</hi> might be inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited before the Moon of a Luminous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an <hi>Opake</hi> Body; in ſo curious an Age, he muſt have ill Luck if he ſhould want his
<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:61773:318"/>Applauders. If ſome Object, that the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of the Books of Scripture in the Hand-Writing of the ſeveral Authors are not ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining; doth this deſerve to be anſwered till they can produce the Original Writings of all other Books? Or at leaſt of all or any that are as Antient, as even the laſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Books of the New Teſtament? Would they have an Office erected to prove the Titles to all Eſtates by Original <hi>Deeds?</hi> and upon what Period of time will they fix for the Date of them, which will admit of any Compariſon with the Date of the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript Copies now extant of the Scriptures? Some have alleged that the Sea through which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> paſſed is not Red: But they may be pleaſed to know that Religion is nothing concerned in what has been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on both ſides upon this ſubject, for it is not called the <hi>Red Sea</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> but the <hi>Sea of Weeds</hi> with which it abounds. It has the denomination of the <hi>Red Sea</hi> from the Greeks, however it came by it (for the Criticks are not agreed about it) and is beſt known by that Name, which is therefore made uſe of by the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and in our own and other Tranſlations, which herein follow St. <hi>Luke</hi> and the Apoſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews.</hi> Men muſt call things by known Names if they will be underſtood, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gave the firſt occaſion to thoſe Names. As to many Objections let Men but do <hi>Moſes</hi>
                     <pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:61773:319"/>the ſame Right, which they would do <hi>Thucydides</hi> or <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and we need deſire no more, tho' they ſhould not allow for the great diſtance of Time between them: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they might live in the ſame Age, for all that many of theſe Objectors know and be next Neighbours. I have known divers Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections made, which the looking only into the Bible would anſwer, and many proceed from the want of being Converſant in it. Some have ſuppoſed that they had great matter of Objection from Chriſt's Curſing the Fig-tree, and cauſing it to wither away: But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little Reflection might ſerve any one to take notice how merciful a thing it was in the Son of God, and how ſuitable to the Goſpel which he Preach'd for him to ſhew his Power of puniſhing upon a Tree rather then upon a Man: it was then and is at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time as eaſy for him to puniſh his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilers, as it was to Curſe this Tree, or as it can be for them to Revile him, tho' they be never ſo ready at it: But to manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the Saviour not the Deſtroyer of mankind: He Cured all manner of Diſeaſes and raiſed the Dead; but never took away the Life of any Man, nor inflicted any Diſeaſe, he ſpared his worſt Enemies the Scribes and Phariſees, and Puniſhed their Hypocriſie in the Emblem only of a Fig-tree flouriſhing in Leaves before the Time and Seaſon of Figs, and thereby promiſing very much an Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:61773:319"/>Fruit but having none; it made a ſhow of Figs out of Seaſon, but had nothing to anſwer ſo fair an Appearance.</p>

And if they find they have been miſtaken and are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:61773:320"/>to be undeceived; this will go ſo far towards their Conviction that I cannot but hope that the Conſideration here propoſed, may be of ſome weight with them.</p>
                  <p>Thus far, methinks, at leaſt I may hope to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon thoſe who will not be convinced of the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, that they will no longer imagine it Safe or Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to ſpeak lightly and profanely of it. Religion is too ſerious a thing, and of too great Concernment to Mankind, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Scorn of every one, that thinks he can make a Jeſt. And that which is too hard, for their Reaſon will be in little danger of their Raillery, but will rather receive an additional Confirmation from it. The beſt and moſt ſacred things are always moſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Diſhonour and Affronts; for to Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front and Abuſe any Perſon or Thing is to endeavour to make it appear bad, and it is the ſecurity of ſome things and ſome Men, that they cannot be repreſented worſe than they are. It is in any ones Power to Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the greateſt Prince, and a Man of the moſt eminent Vertue may be be moſt eaſily abuſed, but no Treaſon can be ſpoke againſt a Beggar, and it is the hardeſt matter to find out how to diſgrace him of whom nothing can be ſaid worſe than he deſerves. It is a kind of Teſtimony given to Religion, and an acknowledgment paid to Vertue, when Men ſo induſtriouſly labour to villify it. For
<pb n="xlvii" facs="tcp:61773:320"/>how can that be diſparaged which is of no Worth or Excellency? Or why ſhould Men endeavour to bring that into diſcredit, which hath not at preſent a confeſſed Reputation? Whether this be a deſerved Reputation or no, they may queſtion if they think fit, but then let them make it a ſerious queſtion, and not to be decided by the loudeſt noiſe. But here is the miſchief, they have no Patience to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Force of an Argument, or to go on with a diſpute; but a Cavil is ſoon ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Objections are more eaſily raiſed than anſwered upon any Subject, and then they trample with wonderful Scorn, and Triumph upon that which they conceive is ſo miſerably overcome: but alaſs the Victory is over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; nothing is either the more or the leſs true for their believing or disbelieving it, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is always the ſame how profanely ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it may be ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>We have no deſign to impoſe upon any Man's Faith; but if there be Reaſon in what we ſay, it may well be expected from Reaſonable Men, that they ſhould hearken to Reaſon. Religion is Reaſon and Philoſophy, as the Fathers often ſpeak, the beſt and trueſt Philoſophy. And I am perſuaded, how much ſoever I may have failed in the performance, that the Chriſtian Religion is capable of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proved with ſuch clear and full Evidence, even to ordinary Underſtandings, as to make all Pretences of Arguing againſt it, appear to be as ridiculous as they are impious.</p>

                     <p>HAving in the former Book proved the Divine Authority of the Scriptures, I proceed in this to clear ſuch points, as are commonly thought moſt liable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in the Chriſtian Religion, and to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61773:330"/>propoſe ſome conſiderations which may ſerve to remove ſuch prejudices, and obviate ſuch cavils, as are uſually raiſed againſt the Holy Scriptures. But before men venture upon making Objections againſt the Scriptures, they would do well firſt to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the compaſs and ſtrength of their own Parts and Faculties, and to obſerve in how many things they daily find themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; how many men there are who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand much more than themſelves, and how much folly and ignorance there is in the wiſeſt men. Thoſe commonly that raiſe objections againſt the Scriptures are as confident in the management of them, as if they underſtood all things beſides, and therefore conclude, that muſt needs be falſe, which they do not underſtand; not conſidering, how very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable it is to ſuppoſe, that God ſhould command and reveal many things, the Natures and Reaſons of which we may not be able to comprehend. This muſt be granted by every man who believes God to be infinitely wiſe, but doth not think himſelf to be ſo, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth God's ſoveraignty over him. For as he is infinitely wiſe, he may reveal things above our capacities, and as he is the ſupream Lord and Governor of the world, he may command us what in his infinite wiſdom he ſhall ſee fitting, tho we may not perceive the Reaſon and Deſign of it. And yet this is the utmoſt, that upon a due examination,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61773:330"/>many of the objections againſt the Authority of the Scriptures amount to, that there are ſeveral things in them, of which ſome men think no clear account can be given, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which ſeem to them unworthy of God.</p>
                     <p>Now what is the meaning of this way of objecting? and where lies the force of ſuch Arguments but in this, that it is not to be conceived, that God would reveal or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any thing, with which they are not ſatisfied, or which they cannot perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand? This is all the ſtrength of this ſort of objections. There is all the Reaſon in the world to believe the Scriptures to be the Word of God, if they did not contain things, which theſe men in their great wiſdom think ſhould not be there, if they were his word; which is to make their own underſtanding the meaſure and <hi>Criterion</hi> of Divine Revelation. And ſome have turned Scepticks for as good Reaſons, and others have been Atheiſts upon the ſame Principles; finding as much fault with the Syſtem of the World, and the Order and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of the parts of it, as the Deiſt doth with the Scriptures; they have renounced all belief of a God, upon the ſame grounds upon which he disbelieves the Chriſtian Religion. To convince men therefore of the Narrowneſs and Weakneſs of Humane Reaſon, I ſhallſhew, I. That in ſome things each ſide of a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction ſeems to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>demonſtrable. II. That very man believes and experiences ſeveral
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61773:331"/>things which in the Theory and ſpeculative Notion of them would ſeem as incredible as any thing in the Scriptures can be ſuppoſed to be. III. That thoſe who reject the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Religion, muſt believe things much more incredible.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. In ſome things each ſide of a Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeems to us demonſtrable. Several inſtances might be given of this. I ſhall inſtance only in the diviſibility of Matter. Nothing ſeems more evident than that diviſibility is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to Matter, and that therefore all Matter is diviſible, ſo that the leaſt part of Matter is as diviſible as the biggeſt, becauſe the leaſt particle of Matter is Matter, that is, it is of the ſame Nature and Eſſence with the whole: and all Matter differs only in Bulk, or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, or Place, or Reſt, or Motion. It being then of the Nature of Matter to be diviſible, it muſt ever be diviſible, tho it be never ſo often divided; ſince it can never be ſo divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as to loſe it own Nature, or ceaſe to be Matter. On the other ſide, it is demonſtrable that Matter cannot be infinitely diviſible; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whatever is diviſible is diviſible into parts, and no parts can be infinite, becauſe no Number can be ſo. For all Number is neceſſarily in it ſelf capable of being counted or numbred, tho no Finite Being may be able to number it, a Numberleſs Number is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, it is a Number, which is no Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: therefore all Number muſt be even or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61773:331"/>odd, and muſt be capable of Addition and Subſtraction, which is contrary to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Infinite. For what is leſs or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er has certain bounds or limits, and therefore cannot be infinite, or without any end or bounds. Matter therefore cannot be diviſible <hi>in Infinitum,</hi> ſince all Diviſion is into Parts, and all Parts are capable of being numbred, that is, they are more or fewer, even or odd. And it will not ſuffice to ſay, that Matter can never actually be divided into infinite Parts, tho it be capable of infinite Diviſion, ſo as that there can be no end of its diviſibility. For the Parts into which it is diviſible muſt be actually exiſtent, tho not actually divided: for nothing can be diviſible into parts which it hath not, and all parts actually exiſtent, whither they be divided, or only diviſible, are capable of being num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, or muſt have a determinate number, and therefore cannot be infinite. But to ſay that theſe Parts of Matter are indefinite, but not infinite, is only to confeſs, that we know not what to ſay of them: for they are inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in reſpect to us, not in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we cannot determine their Number, or what end there can be of dividing them, but this is an argument of our own ignorance, and proves nothing as to the nature of the thing.</p>
                     <p>Again, nothing is clearer to every under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, than that all the parts into which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61773:332"/>the whole is divided, being taken together are equal to the whole: yet it ſeems many ways demonſtrable, that any ſingle part is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the whole. I ſhall give but one ſuch Proof of this, as may be moſt obvious. It muſt be granted, that in any Circle a line may be drawn from every point of the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Center. Suppoſe then the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to be the Aequator, or a line drawn round the Globe of the Earth, and that ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand leſſer Circles are drawn within the Aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor round the ſame Center, and that a right Line is drawn from every point of the Aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to the Center of the Globe; every ſuch Right Line drawn from the Aequator to the Center muſt be of neceſſity cut thro the ten thouſand leſſer Circles drawn about the ſame Center, and conſequently there muſt be the ſame Number of Points in a Circle ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times leſs than the Aequator, that there is in the Aequator it ſelf. And becauſe there may be a Circle drawn from any point of the Diameter, the leſſer Circles may be multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to as many as there are points in the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, which are innumerable, and therefore the leaſt Circle imaginable may by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration have as many points as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, that is, it may be as big as the greateſt, or as big as one never ſo many thouſand times bigger than it ſelf. For all the Lines drawn from the utmoſt Circumference terminate in the Center, which proves that the Center,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61773:332"/>or the leaſt Circle imaginable immediately next to it, muſt be equal to the Circumference never ſo much bigger than it. For to anſwer, that the leſſer Circles have as many points, but not ſo big as the greateſt, is againſt the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, becauſe I ſuppoſe a line drawn from every one of the leaſt points of the greateſt Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, thro the leaſt Circle to the Center, and the leaſt points in the greateſt Circle muſt be as ſmall as any in the leaſt Circle, there being nothing in the nature of Circles or Points to hinder it, and the every Line paſſing from the Circumference to the Center, is ſuppoſed to be of the ſame bigneſs in all its parts, and therefore all the Points of Interſection muſt be equal with thoſe in the Circumference.</p>
                     <p>This proves, that we may loſe our ſelves in the ſpeculation of material things: for when we once abſtract them from ſenſe, and conſider them in the Theory, they become inexplicable: Becauſe our Faculties were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſigned for ſuch ſpeculations, and are not made for them, nor are capable of them, at leaſt in this mortal ſtate. But this is no Argument that our ſenſes rightly diſpoſed, and in due circumſtances, may deceive us in things, which are the Objects of ſenſe, or that we may be deceived in truſting to them. Becauſe what is the object of ſenſe, is the proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for us to judge of by notions derived from our ſenſes, or by the Informations which we receive from them. Our Faculties
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61773:333"/>were deſigned not for meer ſpeculation and curioſity about matters, which perhaps it is impoſſible for us Creatures fully to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, but for our uſe and welfare: they were deſigned to prevent our being deceived in things which are the objects of ſenſe, and therefore all the abſurdities, which are charged upon the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are truly urged, becauſe they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning an object of ſenſe; and all ſuch Maxims, as <hi>the part is leſs than the whole,</hi> &amp;c. muſt hold true, when they are applied to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of ſenſe, tho it be paſt our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to conceive, how they ſhould be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to things, which do not fall under the perception of our ſenſes; for theſe notions were implanted in us, to guide and direct us in the courſe of this life; and we muſt rely upon them, when they are applied only to their proper objects, rather than upon any ſpeculations, which are too nice and high for our conceptions. And it is as abſurd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what contradicts our ſenſes in an object of ſenſe, as to extend theſe Maxims to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which are inſenſible and only in Idea.</p>
                     <p>The ſeeming domonſtration of theſe, and ſuch like contradictions, ariſes from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of the Maxims taken from Phyſical and Material things, to Mathematical Idea's, which are in the mind only, and have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence in the Nature of things. And the ſame abſurdities may be ſtarted upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61773:333"/>ſubject, by confounding the ſeveral No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Properties of things of different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. That the whole is greater than part of it is a Phyſical Axiom and obvious to ſenſe, but that Lines are formed by indiviſible Points, is purely Mathematical Speculation, and the work of Reaſon. So again, that Matter is diviſible is an object of ſenſe, but that divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility is inſeparable from Matter is mere ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, and a deduction which is made from ſenſe, of which our ſenſes can give us no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, but that our Reaſon may be miſtaken in it. And whenever we paſs the proper bounds of each Faculty, and judge the of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties concerning the objects belonging to one Faculty, by abſtracted Notions belonging to another, we muſt neceſſarily fall into error and confuſion. And therefore this muſt needs happen, when we reaſon about objects, which we know only by Revelation, and which are the Natural and Proper objects of none of our Faculties.</p>
                     <p>There are proper Notions and Maxims, which belong to the ſeveral Natures and Kinds of things, and theſe muſt of neceſſity fail us, when they are uſed about things of another Nature. Thus if a man ſhould judge of Sounds by his Ideas of Colours, or of Colours by his Notions of Sounds, he might multiply contradictions without end: and yet theſe are not more different than ſenſible objects are from inſenſible, and material from imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61773:334"/>God may ſee it fitting to reveal ſuch things to us, as are above our underſtandings, but then we muſt be contented to take his word for the Truth of them, and not apply our Principles and Maxims taken from things of an inferiour Nature, to things of which we can have no conception but from revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which would be as abſurd as for a deaf man to apply the Notion which he has of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours to Sounds, or for a blind man to fancy, that there is no ſuch thing as Colours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is told they cannot be heard.</p>
                     <p>And there muſt be a due proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Faculty and its object. For the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties both of our Bodies and Minds are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and limited in their exerciſe about their ſeveral objects. The parts of Matter may be too ſmall and fine to be any longer diſcerned or perceived by ſenſe. For only Bodies, which are ſo big as to reflect a due quantity of Rays to the eye, can be perceived by the ſight it ſelf, the quickeſt and ſubtileſt of all our ſenſes. And as objects in their bulk are ſenſible, but are inſenſible in their minute parts; ſo it is in the inward ſenſations or preceptions of the mind in reſpect of its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. We may puzzle and perplex our ſelves in the deductions, which may be made from the moſt common Notions. Nothing is more certain and familiar to our Minds than our own thoughts that we think, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and will, we all know, but what is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61773:334"/>the principle and ſubject of thought in us, and how our underſtanding and will act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and determine each other, is matter of perpetual diſpute.</p>
                     <p>The ſumm of this argument is, that our Faculties are finite, and of no very large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in their operations, but are confined to certain objects, and limited to certain bounds and periods. Both our Natural and Acquired knowledge is converſant about certain kinds of objects, and our Faculties are fitted and ſuited to them, and from the properties and affections which we obſerve in them, we form Notions, and make Concluſions, and raiſe Maxims and Axioms. Now if we apply our Natural Notions to things which we know only by Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we muſt be very liable to great miſtakes about them. For thus it is in things not ſo much out of the reach of our capacities, and which are not of a ſpiritual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; if we frame ſpeculative and abſtract Ideas from the Principles and Maxims which are formed in our Minds from ſenſible objects, we may ſoon puzzle our ſelves, and ſeem to demonſtrate contradictions; which demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates only, that all arguments of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are vain and unconcluding. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be abſurd to reject the Myſteries of Religion, becauſe they will not come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Rules of Logick and Philoſophy, when they are acknowledged to be incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, and therefore not to be judged of

                        <hi>Quintilian,</hi> aad may be obſerved by any one that will conſider it, that very many
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61773:336"/>things are true, which ſcarce ſeem credible, and as many are falſe, which have all the appearance of Truth; and yet the cauſe of unbelief in matters of Religion is chiefly this, that we are hardly brought to believe any thing poſſible to be done, which we never ſaw done, and judge of things not from any principle of Reaſon, but from our own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and make this the meaſure of what is poſſible to be, not conſidering that many things may be altogether as poſſible, which we never knew done, and that we ſhould think many things impoſſible, of which we have the daily experience if we had never ſeen nor known them to be. For what we have the daily experience of, we are apt to think very eaſy, and ſcarce ſuſpect that there can be any difficulty in it, but frame to our ſelves ſome kind of account of it, and pleaſe ourſelves perhaps with a conceit that we perfectly underſtand it, and conclude, that ſuch and ſuch things muſt needs come to paſs, from the cauſes which we aſſign. For when a thing is common and familiar to us, we either take no pains at all to conſider the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, or when we do obſerve and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, being aſhamed to confeſs our own ignorance, we perſwade ourſelves, that there is no ſuch great difficulty in it, but fancy we underſtand the true Reaſon and Cauſe of it. And if it were not for the careleſneſs of ſome in not minding the wonderful effects of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61773:337"/>Nature, and the Pride of others in fancying that they are ignorant of nothing, which is the conſtant object of their ſenſes, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>that there are ſeveral things in the World, which we daily ſee and experience, that would ſeem as wonderful almoſt as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection itſelf, or any Myſtery in Religion. The greateſt Philoſophers have been able to give but a very imperfect account of the moſt ordinary and obvious things in Nature, and if we had only a relation of them without any tryal or experience, we ſhould be inclin'd to conclude them impoſſible. The King of <hi>Siam,</hi> it is ſaid, would not believe the <hi>Dutch</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, but thought himſelf affronted, when he was told by him, that in <hi>Holland,</hi> Water wou'd become ſo hard in cold weather, that Men or Elephants might walk upon it, and the relations of things in thoſe Countries, would have ſeem'd as ſtrange to us, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant report of men, who have been there, had not made them familiar to us. It was formerly disbelieved, nay abſolutely deny'd, as abſurd and impoſſible, that there could be any ſuch place, as that which is now known by the name of <hi>America,</hi> or that the Torrid and Frigid Zones could be habitable: No my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in Religion can ſeem more incredible to any man, than theſe things did appear even to Wiſe and Learned men, and if they had not been found to be by Navigation, they might have ſeem'd incredible ſtill, for ought we can
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61773:337"/>tell, tho now we wonder at the ignorance of former times, that they ſhould make any doubt of them, and admire how they came to lye ſo long unknown, for theſe things ſeem obvious, when they are once diſcovered, and it would be a diſparagement to us, if we could not make as great diſcoveries at home as thoſe do, who travel to the <hi>Indies.</hi> And if we will but conſider a little with our ſelves, we ſhall find that we may be at leaſt as much miſtaken in our Philoſophy about the things of another World, as our Anceſtors were for ſo many ages concerning ſo much of this, and ſhall conceive it very poſſible, that there may be a Heaven and a Hell, tho we never ſpoke with any body, that had been in either of thoſe places, and that there may be a Trinity and a Reſurrection, tho we were able to give no account of them. For Nature it ſelf exceeds our comprehenſion, and therefore the Divine Eſſence, and the Almighty Power of God muſt needs much more exceed it.</p>
                     <p>The motion of the Heavens, and of the Winds and Seas, the light of the Sun and Moon and Stars, the conception and birth of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nay the growth of Corn, and of the very Graſs of the Field, and all the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and inconſiderable productions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have ſo many wonderful difficulties in the explication of them, that if we were not mightily inclined to flatter our ſelves, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid we ſhould ſooner turn Scepticks, than
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61773:338"/>be able to imagin, that we can give any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable account of them. For when all is done, we know juſt enough of them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and admire the infinite Power and Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, and to be led to a ſtedfaſt belief and aſſurance of what he has revealed of himſelf, and of the World to come; that <hi>the inviſible things of him from the Creation of the World may be clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal Power and Godhead,</hi> Rom. 1.20. How little is it, that we know of this Earth, where we live, and which we dote ſo much upon? For by the leaſt calculation it is above three thouſand and five hundred miles to the Center; but the Art and Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Man has<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> never reached, according to Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s account, after all his enquiries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Navigators and Miners,

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61773:338"/>as he likewiſe obſerves, have been the productions of Time and Chance, not of any Wiſdom or Sagacity.

                     <p>The Circulation of the Blood has been but lately found out, and was looked upon as abſurd at its firſt diſcovery; tho now what man can doubt of it? And ſome of the moſt common effects of Nature might ſeem as ſtrange as any, if the frequency of them did not prevent our wonder.

Might he not object, that it is impoſſible, that the Infant ſhould ever live, and be nouriſhed, and grow in the Womb? and would he not offer abundance of Demonſtrations to prove, that the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Birth of Mankind, and of all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is utterly impoſſible?

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61773:339"/>doubt of things of a Spiritual nature, becauſe we are able to give no ſufficient explication of them, when we are thus at a loſs about the moſt common and obvious things in the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> confutes all objections againſt the Reſurrection by a like Argument, alledging, that as it would be into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably abſurd to deny or doubt of the growth of Corn, becauſe it cannot perfectly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained: ſo it is much more abſurd to deny or doubt of the Reſurrection for no better reaſon, ſince ſupernatural things muſt be more obſcure and harder to be underſtood by us than natural, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.36.</p>
                     <p>Indeed Infidelity could never be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable than in the preſent Age, when ſo many diſcoveries have been made in Natural Philoſophy, which would have been thought as incredible to former Ages, as any thing perhaps that can be imagined, which is not a downright contradiction. That Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or Attractive Force, by which all Bodies act one upon another, at never ſo great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, even through a <hi>Vacuum</hi> of prodigious extent, lately demonſtrated by Mr <hi>Newton;</hi> the Earth, together with the Planets, and the Sun and Stars being placed at ſuch diſtances, and diſpos'd of inſuch order, and in ſuch a manner, as to maintain a perpetual ballance and poiſe throughout the Univerſe, is ſuch a diſcovery, as nothing leſs than a Demonſtration could have gained it any Belief. And this Syſtem
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61773:339"/>of Nature being ſo lately diſcovered, and ſo wonderful, that no account can be given of it by any Hypotheſis in Philoſophy, but it muſt be reſolved into the ſole Power and good Pleaſure of Almighty God, may be a caution againſt all Attempts of eſtimating the Divine Works and Diſpenſations by the Meaſures of Humane Reaſon. The vaſtneſs of the World's extent is found to be ſo prodigious, that it would exceed the Belief not only of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, but of the greateſt Philoſophers, if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted experiments did not aſſure us of the Truth of it.

                     <p>To ſay nothing of the ſtrange Diſcoveries concerning the Formation and Contexture of the Bodies both of Plants and Animals; the innumerable little Animals, which are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by Microſcopes in but one drop of water, and many other obſervations of the like nature, are ſo wonderful, that we might well ſuſpect the truth of the experiments, if men of the greateſt skill and integrity, as well in our own, as in other Countreys, did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in them. The vaſt quantities of water, which are continually flowing out of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand Rivers into the Sea keep their conſtant courſe, and are ſome way ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of, as that the Sea and Land retain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a due proportion to each other. But the Original of the Fountains from whence
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61773:341"/>thoſe Rivers proceed, and how this Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Waters is made, is ſtill matter of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. The concuſſions of Earthquakes reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometimes to ſo vaſt an extent, and the prodigious eruptions of Fire from divers burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mountains in ſeveral parts of the Earth, throwing out abundance of matter in Rivers of Fire of great breadth for many miles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſeem incredible to thoſe, who have not read and conſidered theſe things. The Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity of the Loadſtone, the Flux and Reflux of the Sea, Life and Motion, every thing in Natural Philoſophy, when ſeriouſly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, has ſo many inexplicable Difficulties, as would make a conſiderate man very modeſt in his Cenſures concerning things ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. For if we had been placed in another World, a Natural Hiſtory of this might have ſeemed as ſtrange to us, as any thing Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed can do now. And it muſt be great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in us, who know ſo little of the World we live in, to talk pragmatically of another, which we have only been told of; and to believe no more than our Sences can inform us of, when every Sence may inform us, how narrow and imperfect our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is, and that we take upon Truſt, or ſwallow in the Groſs, what we are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaſt diſtruſtful about. And not only Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but even Art exceeds the Apprehenſions of moſt men. The <hi>Mechanical Powers</hi> and <hi>Motions</hi> are wont to be miſtaken for <hi>Magick</hi>
                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:61773:342"/>by ſuch as have not skill and experience in thoſe matters; the performances of <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> were ſo wonderful beyond all expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or belief, that the King of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> is ſaid to have made a Decree, to forbid any man to queſtion whatever <hi>Archimedes</hi> ſhould aſſert. The Force of Gun-powder might be thought incredible, if it were not ſo common amongſt us. Not to mention, that the <hi>Indians</hi> took Watches for Animals, and could not imagine, how men could hold correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at a diſtance by a little piece of Paper. What man is there among the Vulgar that can conceive, how the dimenſions and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Sun and Stars can be taken, and how the Eclipſes of the Sun and Moon, and of the Satellites of <hi>Jupiter</hi> can be calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated? And is not the knowledge of the wiſeſt man upon earth infinitely more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd by the Divine Wiſdom, than his Knowledge can excel that of the greateſt Idiot?</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Thoſe who disbelieve and reject the Myſteries of Religion, muſt believe things much more incredible. I. He that will not believe the Being of an Eternal God, muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Matter to be eternal: for it is certain ſomething muſt be eternal, becauſe nothing could produce nothing; and unleſs there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had been ſomething, there never could have been any thing. But this Eternal Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt either have been once without Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61773:342"/>or always with it: if it were once with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Motion, then Matter muſt move itſelf, that is, Motion muſt be produced without any thing to produce it. If it were always in Motion, then there muſt have been an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Succeſſion, ſince Motion cannot be all at once; for the very nature of Motion ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes Progreſſion, and no Body can move in this ſpace and the next at the ſame inſtant: for then it muſt be in two places at once. But all Succeſſion of Duration is gradual, and the Degrees of it are capable of being numbred; and to ſuppoſe an Eternal Succeſſion is to ſuppoſe an Infinite Number; that is, a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to which nothing can be added, and from which nothing can be ſubſtracted; or a Number which is no Number. Motion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not be Eternal, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the World could not exiſt from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                     <p>But ſince there muſt be ſomething Eternal, there muſt be ſomething, the duration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is indiviſible, or which has all its exiſtence together, ſo as to have exiſted now no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than it had done before the Beginning of the World. For this is the notion of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that it has neither Beginning nor End: and therefore things eternal never had a leſs or ſhorter duration, than they now have, and can never have a longer after millions of Ages, than they had the firſt year, or day, from
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61773:343"/>whence we may be ſuppoſed to begin the computation of thoſe Ages. For a longer or ſhorter Duration muſt ſuppoſe a Beginning, from whence the computation is made; and therefore that which is eternal, and had no Beginning, can have neither a longer nor a ſhorter Duration, but always the ſame: and by conſequence Time can bear no proportion to Eternity, becauſe that which had a Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning can bear no proportion to that which had none. Yet Eternity muſt coexiſt with Time, in all the differences and ſucceſſions of it, and muſt be preſent with every part of it; that is, the Eternal Being exiſts the ſpace, ſuppoſe, of a thouſand years, and a Temporal, or Created Being exiſts at the ſame time as long, and the Temporal Being becomes a thouſand years older than it was, but the Eternal no older than it was before; becauſe tho it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſt with Time, yet it has no reſpect to the diviſion of it into Paſt, Preſent and Future. There is no Myſtery in Religion more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and perplexing than this; and yet this is no more than what every one, tho he be a Deiſt, or an Atheiſt, muſt acknowledge to believe, if he will but conſider it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whoever believes that there is a God, and yet believes no Revelation, or that the Scriptures are not by Revelation from him, muſt believe a God, and yet deny the Divine Attributes; he muſt believe that there is a

                     <p>ALl the Motion of Material things is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from God, and the beſt account which thoſe who have the moſt ſtudied the nature of Motion, have been able to give of it is only this, that it is an effect of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power manifeſting itſelf according to certain Laws or Rules, which God has been pleaſed to preſcribe for the communication of Motion from one Body to another. And it is at leaſt as conceivable by us, that God doth
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61773:344"/>act upon the Immaterial, as that he acts upon the material part of the World, and highly reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that he concerns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with our Souls much more than with our Bodies. There is no doubt to be made, but that ſeparate and unbodied ſpirits have ways of of converſing, or communicating their thoughts to one another: indeed all the communication and diſcourſe, that is among men in this world, is properly between their Souls, which uſe their Bodies as inſtruments for the conveyance of their Thoughts and Notions from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and as their Bodies are more or leſs fit and ſerviceable to this end, ſo their diſcourſe is more or leſs eaſily convey'd, and therefore Souls when they are at Liberty from theſe Bodies muſt have a Power to communicate their own thoughts in a way much more free and unconfin'd than in this Life; as they have more knowledge in a ſeparate ſtate, ſo they muſt have fitter means to communicate it. And ſince the happineſs of Heaven conſiſts in the Viſion of God, that is, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of the Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs, God certainly can as well act upon the minds of Men in this mortal ſtate, tho we be leſs capable of receiving or obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the influences of his Spirit. Since finite Spirits can act one upon another, it is reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to believe that the Spirit of God, <hi>the God of the Spirits of all fleſh</hi> doth move and work upon the Spirits of Men, that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61773:345"/>their underſtandings, and inclines their Wills by a ſecret Power and Influence in the methods of his ordinary Grace. And he can likewiſe act upon the Wills and the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of ſome men with a clearer and more powerful Light and Force, than he is pleaſed to do upon others, in ſuch a manner as to render them infallible in receiving and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering his Pleaſure and Commandments to the World. He can ſo reveal himſelf to them, by the Operations of his Holy Spirit, as that they ſhall be infallibly aſſur'd of what is revealed to them, and as infallibly aſſure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of it. Which kind of Revelation is ſtyl'd Inſpiration, becauſe God doth not only move and actuate the minds of ſuch men; but vouchſafes to 'em the extraordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of his Spirit; the Spirit then more eſpecially may be liken'd to the Winds, to which it is compared in Scripture: for by ſtrong convictions and forcible, but gracious Impreſſious he breaths upon their Souls, and infuſes his Divine Truths into them. But upon thoſe, to whom God did thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal himſelf by inward light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he did moreover beſtow a power of giving external evidence by miraculous works, that their pretences were real, and that what they ſpoke was not of them, but was reveal'd to them from God.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61773:346"/>them, as to give infallibly the ſenſe and full importance of the Revelation. In matters of Fact, their Memories were according to our Saviours promiſe aſſiſted and confirm'd. In matters of Diſcourſe or Reaſoning, either from their own natural Notions, or from things Reveal'd, or from matters of Fact, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings were enlightned, and their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſtrengthned. And ſtill in all caſes their natural Faculties were ſo ſupported and guided both in their Notions and Words, as that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould come into their Writings, but what is infallibly true. They had always the uſe of their Faculties, tho under the infallible Direction and Conduct of the Holy Ghoſt, and in things that were the proper objects of their faculties, the Holy Ghoſt might only ſupport and guide them, as in matters of ſenſe and natural Reaſon and Memory, and in their Words and Style to expreſs all theſe. But in things of an higher Nature, which were above their faculties, and which they could have no knowledge of, but from Revelation, the things themſelves were infuſed, tho the words in moſt caſes might be their own, but they were preſerv'd from error in the uſe of them by that Spirit, who was to <hi>guide them into all Truth.</hi>

                     <p>For tho the ſeveral Writers of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures might be allowed to uſe their own Words and Style, yet it was under the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible guidance and influence of the Spirit, as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61773:346"/>when a man is left to the uſe of his own <hi>Hand,</hi> or manner of Writing, but is directed in the Senſe and Orthography by one who dictates to him, or aſſiſts him with his help, where it is needful. <hi>Prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God ſpake, as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> 2 Pet. 1.21. <hi>All Scripture is given by Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God:</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſaith,</hi> by the Pſalmiſt, <hi>to day if ye will hear his Voice,</hi> Hebr. 3.7. <hi>David</hi> ſaith of himſelf, <hi>the Spirit of the Lord ſpake by me, and his word was in my Tongue,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.2. And God is ſaid to <hi>ſpeak by the hand of Moſes his ſervant, and by the hand of his ſervant Ahijah the Prophet,</hi> 1 Kings 8.53.14.18. By which it appears, that he uſed the Prophets as his Inſtruments in revealing his Will: For as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were by the immediate power of God, though wrought by the hands of men, ſo the Revelations were of God, though ſpoken or written by the Prophets and Apoſtles. But though God uſed them as his Inſtruments, yet not as mechanical, but as rational Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and as in working their Miracles, they were not always neceſſarily determined to the place, or to the perſons on whom they were wrought, but in general were guided to work them, when they were proper and ſeaſonable; and the Actions, by which they wrought them, were their own, though the power
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61773:347"/>that accompanied them was of God; ſo in their Doctrines, they might be permitted to uſe their own Words and Phraſes, and to be guided by prudential Motives, as to time, and place, and perſons, with a directive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er only over them, to ſpeak and write no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but infallible truth, upon ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in ſuch circumſtances, as might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the end of their Miſſion, with which they were entruſted.</p>
                     <p>God promiſed <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he ſent him to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that he <hi>would be with his mouth,</hi> and <hi>with Aaron's mouth,</hi> and would <hi>teach them what they ſhould ſay,</hi> Exod. 4.12, 15. And our Saviour tells his Diſciples, <hi>ye ſhall be brought before Governours and Kings for my ſake, for a teſtimony againſt them and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: But when they deliver you up, take no thought, how or what ye ſhall ſpeak, for it ſhall be given you in that ſame hour what ye ſhall ſpeak,</hi> Matt. 10.18, 19.

He writes for the ſame reaſon to the <hi>Theſſalonians, ye know what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments we gave you by the Lord Jeſus,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4.2. and he diſtinguiſheth between his own Judgment (aſſiſted and enlightened, though not infallibly, by the Holy Ghoſt) and the Commandments of the Lord, or the infallible dictates of the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 7.10, 12, 25, 40. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt taught</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <hi>all things, and brought all things to their remembrance,</hi> Jo. 14.26. and <hi>guided them into all Truth,</hi> Joh. 16.13. <hi>and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction from the holy one</hi> inſtructed 'em to <hi>know all things,</hi> 1 Joh. 11.20. that is, all things pertaining to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; this is ſaid of their Diſciples, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may in a more eſpecial manner be affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Apoſtles themſelves; inſomuch that the words themſelves are aſcribed to the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>which things alſo we ſpeak not in the words which mans wiſdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth, comparing ſpiritual things with ſpiritual,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.13. For they were under the conduct and influence of the Holy Ghoſt in the choice of every word they uſed, tho not ſo, as to be inſpired with a new ſtyle and dialect; the words themſelves were not always ſuggeſted, but they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways inſpired in the uſe of them; and tho
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61773:348"/>they might be permitted to chuſe their own words and expreſſions, yet it was with this limitation, that they were never permitted to make choice of ſuch, as would not fully and infallibly expreſs the mind of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>And therefore 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.13. the Apoſtle gives this direction, <hi>Wherefore let him that ſpeaketh in an unknown tongue, pray that he may interpret;</hi> that is, let him pray, that he may have the Divine Inſpiration to aſſiſt him in expreſſing himſelf in a known tongue, by which he is enabled to ſpeak in an unknown one, and that he may be infallible in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring that in his own tongue, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly ſpeaks in another. Which makes it evident, that when they ſpoke by Inſpiration in their own language, they had the Guidance and Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt in the uſe of their words; and this was the reaſon why thoſe that ſpoke by Inſpiration in a ſtrange tongue, durſt not preſume to interpret the words, which the Holy Ghoſt dictated to them in that tongue, ſo as to give them out for Divine Revelation, unleſs they were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly empowered to render them in their own language with the ſame exactneſs, with which they were inſpired to ſpeak in a ſtrange tongue. For that the neceſſity of praying that they might interpret, could not proceed from any inability to interpret by reaſon of the force and heat of the Rapture which was
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61773:348"/>upon 'em, that made 'em unable to utter their conceptions in their own language, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſenſe of them in their minds after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſeems plain from verſe 27. <hi>if any man ſpeak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the moſt by three, and that by courſe, and let one interpret, &amp;c.</hi> For if they had been act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch rapturous heats and extaſies, they could have been as little able to refrain, when the Rapture was upon them, and to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what they had to deliver, when their courſe came to ſpeak, as they are ſuppoſed to have been to remember what they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to ſpeak in one language, when they went to expreſs it in another. Neither were they ignorant themſelves of what they ſpoke, but when it is ſaid <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>for if I pray in an unknown tongue my ſpirit prayeth, but my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is unfruitful;</hi> the meaning of that is, that it was of no benefit to others, tho <hi>he that ſpeaketh in an unknown tongue edifyeth himſelf,</hi> verſ. 4. Some men were inſpired to ſpeak in ſtrange tongues with as much readineſs, and more exactneſs than they could do in their native language; but this was inſignificant to ſuch as underſtood not the tongue in which they ſpoke. <hi>What is it then? I will pray with the ſpirit, and I will pray with the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo,</hi> verſ. 15. <hi>i. e.</hi> I will pray by the Guidance and Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, but in my own language, in which my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is employed, and the words are
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61773:349"/>not all directly ſuggeſted to me by the Spirit (as they muſt be in a language which I ſpeak meerly by Inſpiration) but I am only ſo far guided and aſſiſted in the choice and uſe of my words, as to ſpeak infallibly the mind of the ſpirit. <hi>Elſe when thou ſhalt bleſs with the ſpirit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſe</hi> 16. Thoſe who had the gift of tongues were, it ſeems, ſo pufft up with it, that they would worſhip God in no other but in thoſe languages, tho none of the Aſſembly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood them, and would be always unneceſſarily and unſeaſonably repeating the Revelations, which they had received in ſtrange languages; the Apoſtle tells ſuch men that it was very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and abſurd to deliver their Revelations in an unknown Tongue, or to pray or give thanks in a Language not underſtood by thoſe that heard them, but that they ſhould pray that they might interpret, or forbear the uſe of the gift of to agues, unleſs before them who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Tongues in which they ſpoke, that it might be for edification. For in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations they were conſined at certain times to ſome particular Language, <hi>as the Spirit gave them utterance;</hi> and it might have done great prejudice to the Truth of Religion, if they of themſelves had ventured to render that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own Language, which was revealed to them in a ſtrange Tongue: and for this reaſon it was not permitted thoſe, who ſpoke with Tongues, to ſpeak in any but that, in which the Revelation was made to them, unleſs
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61773:349"/>they were enabled to do it by being inſpired with a Power of Interpretation. For <hi>to ſpeak with tongues</hi> and <hi>to interpret</hi> were diſtinct gifts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10, 30. and whatever gift any one had received, he was confined to the exerciſe of it, and might not preſume to pretend to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, which he had not received.</p>
                     <p>The gift of <hi>tongues,</hi> and of the <hi>interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of tongues,</hi> being ſo particularly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, this muſt imply, that the Apoſtles (who are ſuppoſed to have had all the gifts, which others had but in part) were guided by the Spirit in their words and expreſſions, ſince thoſe who ſpoke by the Spirit, were unable to interpret without a particular gift; for no interpretation was ſufficient, but ſuch as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the ſenſe with infallible truth and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and if this exactneſs of words was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in their Aſſemblies, it muſt be much rather neceſſary in the writings of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts. Among other gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, are reckon'd <hi>the word of wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>the word of knowledge,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.8. the former <hi>Grotius</hi> underſtands of ſpeaking wiſe ſayings, and the latter of knowledge in Hiſtory; and to the reſt was added the gift of <hi>diſcerning of ſpirits,</hi> v. 10. And as there were ſeveral gifts, ſo there were ſeveral of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12. Now the ſeveral gifts of the Holy Ghoſt were not all beſtowed ordinarily upon the ſame perſon, but ſuch as were neceſſary for that office and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61773:350"/>which he was to execute. But as the Apoſtolical Power comprehended in it the powers of every other office, ſo it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that they ſhould poſſeſs the gifts proper for the performance of whatever was to be done by them. And when God, by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and diſpoſal of things, gave the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts occaſions of writing upon ſuch and ſuch ſubjects, and to ſuch and ſuch perſons, or Churches, he by his Spirit inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excited and aſſiſted them in it, beſtowing upon them the gifts of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and of writing and ſpeaking either in their own or any other Language, in which they were required to write or ſpeak: For we are not to ſuppoſe that any gifts were beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon others, and yet denied to them, to whom they were moſt uſeful and neceſſary, in order to the delivering of that Faith and Doctrine, which was to be the ſtanding rule for the attainment of Salvation to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans unto the end of the world. When others had the gift of ſpeaking and interpreting ſtrange Languages, it cannot be conceived that the writers of the Holy Scriptures ſhould be refuſed that neceſſary aſſiſtance in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages in which they wrote, that might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from error; and if any, without the gifts proper for it, had undertaken any office or miniſtration, the gift of <hi>diſcerning of Spirits</hi> was a ſecurity to the Church from any hurt that might enſue by the pretences of ſuch undertakers.</p>

                     <p>We may be certain, that all the Gifts, which were beſtowed for the edification of the Church, were (as far as they were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) vouchſafed more eſpecially to all ſuch, as were to leave behind them for the benefit of the Church in all Ages, an account of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and the terms of the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be obtained thereby; and that no ſuch Guidance and Direction of the Holy Ghoſt was wanting as might preſerve them from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in any particular: for there is no particular, but it will fall under ſome one of thoſe gifts, which were beſtowed upon the firſt Diſciples. They were not neceſſarily to write in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and elegant ſtyle, but in ſuch as was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from error in whatever they delivered. To what purpoſe elſe had been ſo many ſeveral Gifts? To keep them from groſs errors and fundamental miſtakes there could have been no need of ſuch a variety of Gifts: but when every ſort of error, which men are prone to, had a Remedy provided to prevent it, we may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that no error was ſuffered in thoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which were the moſt important work of the Apoſtolical Function, and deſigned <hi>for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt</hi> not in one Age and Nation only, but throughout all Ages, and in all parts of the World.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. I ſhall now proceed to make ſuch Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, as may afford a ſufficient Anſwer to the objections alledged upon this ſubject.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. The Inſpiration of the Writers of the Scriptures did not exclude humane means, ſuch as information in matters of fact, either by their own ſenſes, or by the teſtimony of others; or reaſoning from their own noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and obſervations: but the Holy Ghoſt guided them infallibly in the uſe of all ſuch means.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Inſpiration of the Prophets and Apoſtles or Evangeliſts did not exclude the uſe of their own words and ſtyle: and as they might be permitted the uſe of theſe, ſo they might be permitted, or in ſome caſes directed to uſe the words of others. Many things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in one Book of the Scriptures are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe delivered in another, and ſome things are repeated in the ſame words, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing the ſame things, and in the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words, at different times, and by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent perſons, might make the Revelation of them the more evident and remarkable. For that, in which ſeveral inſpired perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, is the more taken notice of, and becomes the more obſerved, as a thing of great weight and moment. The reaſon why <hi>the Dream was doubled unto</hi> Pharaoh <hi>twice, was becauſe the thing was eſtabliſhed by God, and God would ſhortly bring it to paſs,</hi> Gen 41.32. It is in this as it is in all other things, it is expedient, that in matters of great concernment, there ſhould be the more ſolemnity, and that they ſhould be the oftner repeated and the more inſiſted
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61773:351"/>upon; and if they be expreſt in the ſame words, this implies, that thoſe words carry more than ordinary weight in them: And therefore not only all the Divine Writers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the ſame purpoſe and deſign, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p n="3">3. Tho ſome things are ſet down in the Scriptures indefinitely, and without any poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive aſſertion or determination, this is no proof againſt their being written by Divine Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For this doth not prove, that the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of thoſe paſſages were uncertain and doubtful in the particulars ſo expreſt, becauſe the things were of that nature, that it was needleſs to ſpeak preciſely of them: As when St <hi>John</hi> ſays, Jo. 21.8. <hi>They were not far from Land, but as it were two hundred Cubits,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not from hence be concluded that the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt was ignorant how far they were from Land: For it was not material to his deſign to be more particular in a circumſtance of that nature; but it was ſufficient to ſay, that they were about two hundred Cubits off at Sea; and it is uſual with all Writers to omit fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and inſert only whole numbers, when it is not material to their purpoſe to inſiſt upon
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61773:352"/>every minute circumſtance. It is ordinary with the beſt Writers to expreſs things uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, which they were notwithſtaning throughly acquainted withal, and to ſeem ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of things, which they perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, but paſt over as not worth the taking notice of, or not conſiderable enough for them to own the knowledge of them. It is a known Elegancy to ſay, <hi>neſcio quid,</hi> or <hi>neſcio quem,</hi> when the Author ſo ſpeaking was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the thing or perſon there meant, but either ſignified his contempt of the perſon or thing, or intimated that it was not worth his while to trouble himſelf, or his Hearers or Readers with a more particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61773:352"/>to the miraculous draught of Fiſhes, to know whether the Ship were two hundred cubits, or half a cubit, or a quarter of a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit over or under from the Land, and it is uſual with St <hi>John</hi> to expreſs himſelf in this manner, <hi>Jo.</hi> 2.6. 6.10. 19.14.</p>
                     <p>Either then (to keep to the ſame inſtance) St <hi>John</hi> might know the preciſe diſtance, and for the reaſons mentioned, not declare it, or, it not being of any uſe or conſequence for us to be more particularly informed in a matter of that nature, the Holy Ghoſt might ſuffer him to be ignorant of it, if he had no other means of knowing it but by Inſpiration: For the Holy Ghoſt aſſiſted the Apoſtles and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts to write infallible Truth, but not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to write every little circumſtance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the things which they relate. Many Miracles are wholly omitted, and many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances not conſiderable or material to be mentioned, are omitted, of thoſe Miracles which are recorded. But if nothing be related which may lead us into error, and nothing omitted which is neceſſary to be known, this is ſufficient, and is all that can be expected in a Book, which is to be a Rule of Faith and Manners to us. It is neceſſary that nothing but Truth ſhould be contained in it, but not that every Truth ſhould be in it: for then <hi>the world itſelf could not contain the Books that ſhould be written.</hi> Suppoſe therefore that St <hi>John</hi> did not know preciſely how many cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61773:353"/>the Ship was from ſhore; what doth this prove? That he did not know the Miracle which he there relates? Doth it prove that he was not inſpired in what he doth relate, if he were not inſpired in what he omits? If he had determined the preciſe diſtance, and had not known it, this might have diſcredited the Authority of his Goſpel, but when he has not determined it, can this be an argument in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of its Authority, if he did not know what he did not profeſs to know? Is it not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> good Argument in confirmation of its Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that he would aſſert nothing but what he certainly knew, if in what he was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſectly aſſured, he mentions no further than he knew of it? So St <hi>Paul</hi> acquaints us, when he ſpoke himſelf, and <hi>not the Lord,</hi> which is an argument to us, that in all other caſes he did not ſpeak of himſelf, but the Lord ſpoke by him: it is a conſirmation of his Integrity, that he would impoſe nothing upon us as of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority, which is not really ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he that told us in any one caſe, that he ſpoke of himſelf, not as from the Lord, would have made the ſame Declaration in other caſes, whenever he had written any thing without expreſs Revelation.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In things, which might fall under hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Prudence and Obſervation, there the Spirit of God ſeems not to have dictated im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the Prophets and Apoſtles, but only to have uſed a directive or conducting
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61773:353"/>Power and Influence, ſo as to ſupply ſuch Thoughts and Apprehenſions to them as might be moſt proper and ſeaſonable, and to keep them in the uſe of their own Reaſon, within the bounds of Infallible Truth, and of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency for the preſent caſe and occaſion. They might be permitted to inſert ſuch things as the ſtate of affairs required; which tho not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately dictated by the Holy Ghoſt, yet were agreeable to the end and deſign of his Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſerviceable to the Miniſtry, to which they were appointed. There ſeems to be no neceſſity to aſſert, that St <hi>Paul</hi> ſent for his Cloak and Parchments by Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, or that he had any immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate command or direction to ſalute the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons named at the end of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; but only that his Doctrine was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt: and as he might be permitted to put that into his own words, but ſo as never to be ſuffered to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it otherwiſe than in ſuch a manner, as was fully agreeable to the mind and intention of the Holy Spirit, and therefore infallibly true: So in theſe leſſer and indifferent matters, which ſome preſent occaſion made requiſite to be written of, he had the guidance and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Holy Ghoſt to prevent him from writing any thing, but what was expedient in thoſe circumſtances, and ſerviceable to his calling and miniſtry in the propagation of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:61773:354"/>
                     <p>But things of an indifferent nature in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves might become neceſſary as to time and place, and perſons, and therefore might in ſome caſes be of Divine Inſpiration. St <hi>Paul</hi>'s journeying into <hi>Macedonia</hi> rather than into any other Country, was in itſelf a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, but the ſalvation of many ſouls might depend upon it, and therefore he was warned by Revelation not <hi>to preach the word in Aſia,</hi> nor <hi>to go into Bithynia,</hi> but into <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> Acts 16.6, 7, 9. In like manner the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations of particular perſons at the end of his Epiſtles, tho they may ſeem to us to be of no great importance, yet might be of mighty conſideration and conſequence to thoſe who were concerned in them. To be ſaluted by an Apoſtle in ſo particular and ſolemn a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, might revive their ſpirits, and encourage them to perſeverance under their Temptations and Aſſlictions: for his Salutations include his Benediction, which was the exerciſe of his Apoſtolick Office and Authority in one great branch of it. And God himſelf might direct the Apoſtle to ſalute ſuch perſons for their ſupport and comfort, and encouragement in the Faith. Beſides, the Salutation added at the end of the Epiſtles are a confirmation of the Authority of them: the perſons there mentioned were as ſo many Witneſſes, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt that they were genuine. For, beſides the general concernment of the Catholick Church, and of the ſeveral Churches more eſpecially,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61773:354"/>to which ſuch Epiſtles were written, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who were ſaluted by name in them, were more particularly concerned to take cognizance of them, and to know all the circumſtances relating to them.</p>
                     <p>And St <hi>Paul</hi>'s advice to <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>drink no longer Water, but to uſe a little Wine for his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach's ſake, and his often infirmities,</hi> 1 Tim. v. 23. was requiſite to be given in that Epiſtle, that it might remain recorded in the Scriptures, in confutation of that ſuperſtition, which ſome were guilty of in abſtaining from things lawful, (and particularly from Wine) out of an opinion of Holineſs in refraining from them, and of ſin in the uſe of them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That infallible Spirit which aſſiſted and inſpired the Apoſtles and other Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, was not permanent and habitual, or continually reſiding in them, nor given for all purpoſes and occaſions; as we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in St <hi>Paul,</hi> who acquaints us in ſome things that he had not received of the Lord what he writes. But the gifts of the Spirit were beſtowed for the benefit and edification of the Church; and therefore w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>re given in ſuch meaſures, at ſuch times, and upon ſuch occaſions, as might be uſeful for edification. We find that in a matter of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and importance to the whole Church, the Apoſtles met together in Councel, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the controverſy; both, becauſe according to our Saviours promiſe to them, they might
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61773:355"/>expect a more abundant effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, when they were aſſembled in his name for that purpoſe; and becauſe the thing in debate depended upon Matter of Fact, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Holy Ghoſt was given to the Gentiles, and therefore it was requiſite that many ſhould meet together, and teſtifie of that matter. Beſides, ſeveral that came down from <hi>Judea</hi> to <hi>Antioch</hi> had refuſed to ſubmit to the Authority of St <hi>Paul</hi> and St <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi> and it was neceſſary that theſe men ſhould be convinced by the unanimous and joint Authority of the Apoſtles, who being met in a full Councel declared, <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and to us,</hi> Acts 15.28. that is, not only to us, but to the Holy Ghoſt, to the Holy Ghoſt as well as to us. And this was for an Example and Precedent to the Church in future Ages, to determine Controverſies by the Authority of Councels.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon men, who might have perſonal failings, and were <hi>men of like Paſſions</hi> with us, Act. 14.25. <hi>They had this Treaſure in earthen Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, that the excellency of the Power might be of God, and not of themſelves,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.7. But they werechoſen to be Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, and therefore muſt be ſo far exempt from error in the execution of their Office and Miniſtry, as not to deliver falſe Doctrines in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which were to be read and received of all Churches in all Ages of the World; for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61773:355"/>this would have defeated and ſubverted the deſign of the Inſtitution of the Apoſtles, and of the Miſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this God would not ſuffer, tho they might be ſuffered to incur ſuch failings as were no prejudice to the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. There being nothing aſſerted in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of Scripture but what has ſome relation to the edification of the Church, tho ſome parts of it have a leſs direct and apparent ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to this end than others; if any one paſſage or circumſtance ſhould have been er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, this would diminiſh the Authority of the Scriptures, and make them in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree leſs capable to promote the end for which they were written. And there being ſo many particular Gifts, the Gift <hi>of Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>of Knowledge; of Tongues,</hi> and <hi>of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Tongues,</hi> and <hi>of diſcerning of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:</hi> and ſo many diſtinct Offices, as <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and <hi>Paſtors,</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> we cannot conceive how thoſe Gifts and theſe Offices could be better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed than in preſerving that Book from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, which was to be the ſtandard of Truth for all Ages; or how, if that Book had not been ſecured from error by them, theſe Gifts and Offices had anſwered the end of their appointment.</p>
                     <p>Thus much may ſuffice to prove the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to be infallible in all the parts and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of them. But it may be obſerved,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61773:356"/>that if the Infallibility of the Sacred Writers had not extended to the words and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but only to the ſubſtantial and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental points of Religion, this of itſelf were enough to vindicate the Divine Authority of the Chriſtian Religion. Nay further, if the Scriptures were written only with the ſame certainty and integrity that is in <hi>Thucydides,</hi> or in any other credible Hiſtorian (which the moſt obſtinate and inveterate Adverſary can never deny) yet even then no man without much unreaſonableneſs cou'd reject it.</p>

And the Orators both among the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> were as exact and curious in the Feet and Meaſure of their Proſe, as the Poets could be in Verſe. Great part of the Scriptures is in Verſe, and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent way of writing in different Ages and Nations, appears in nothing more, than in the ſeveral ſorts of Poetry. That way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all Verſe in Rhime, which in theſe parts of the World is moſt in uſe and eſteem, would have been ridiculous to the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi> Tho' the uſe of Rhime in Verſe is ſo far from being example in Antiquity, that it is perhaps the moſt ancient of all ways of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Verſe.

Verſes compoſed in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſtick and Alphabetical way, were found to be a help to the Memory, and this benefit, and the ornament which it was then ſuppoſed to give to Poems, is the cauſe why it is ſometimes uſed in the Scriptures: and ſometimes the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration

Rhophalick Verſes, which begin with a Monoſyllable, every word encreaſing by one ſyllable more than the former, are to be found in <hi>Homer:</hi> and the <hi>Leonine</hi> or Monkiſh Verſes with a double Rhime, one in the middle, and the other at the end, are not without precedent. To ſay nothing of the Poems compoſed of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts of Verſe, and framed into the ſhape of ſeveral things by <hi>Simmias Rhodius,</hi> ſome of which are aſcribed to <hi>Theocritus.</hi> The Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions ſo frequent in <hi>Homer,</hi> were not for want of words, (for no Author ever wanted them leſs than he) but out of choice, though latter Poets have not thought fit to imitate him in this, and <hi>Martial</hi> turn'd it to Ridicule. It is certain that nothing is more various, than
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61773:365"/>the Wit and Fancy of Man, and it is as certain, that whoever would write to any purpoſe, muſt write in ſome ſuch manner, as the temper of the people, to whom he writes, will bear, and as their cuſtoms require.</p>
                     <p>But before I leave this particular, it may be proper to conſider the ſtile of Scripture, in the Metaphorical and Figurative uſe of words, in ſpeaking of the Works and Attributes of God. There never was any Book written in a ſtrict and literal propriety of words, becauſe all Languages abound in Metaphors, which by conſtant uſe become perhaps better known to the Natives of a Country, than the original words themſelves, and in proceſs of time of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten cauſe them to be quite laid aſide. But then this borrowed and Metaphorical ſenſe of words may be very ſtrange to Men of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, eſpecially when they are taken for things peculiar to the place, where they are uſed. The <hi>Horn of the Son of Oyl</hi> ſignifies in our way of expreſſion <hi>a very fruitful Hill,</hi> Iſa. 5.1. and <hi>Horn</hi> ſignified ſtrength in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, as familiarly, as <hi>Robur</hi> or <hi>Oak</hi> ſignifies the ſame in <hi>Latin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And not only the Valleys are ſaid <hi>to ſhout and ſing,</hi> Pſ. 65.13. but the <hi>beſt Fruits in the Land,</hi> are in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> called <hi>the ſinging of the Land,</hi> Gen. 43.11. The word <hi>Rock</hi> is often uſed to denote the Almighty Power of God, and by the <hi>Septuagint</hi> and vulgar <hi>Latin,</hi> is ſometimes tranſlated <hi>God. For their Rock is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61773:366"/>not as our Rock, even our Enemies being Judges,</hi> Deut. 32.31. thoſe verſions render it <hi>their Gods,</hi> and <hi>our God,</hi> and in like manner, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 15, 18. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 31.3.73.26. <hi>Is there any God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides me? yea there is no God, I know not any,</hi> Iſai. 46.8. in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is, there is no <hi>Rock</hi> as the Margin of our Bibles remarks.</p>
                     <p>This uſe of Metaphors ariſeth partly from the likeneſs that is perceiv'd between things, which makes one thing to be expreſt by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and gives a delightful illuſtration to the things diſcourſed of, and partly from our want of fit words to expreſs the various na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of things, eſpecially of things ſpiritual, which we commonly ſpeak of in Negative terms, and rather deny, that they are like things ſenſible, than poſitively affirm what they are: Thus we ſay that they are imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, inviſible, incorruptible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when we ſpeak poſitively of them, we muſt uſe ſuch words, as ſenſible objects can furniſh us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, ſince we can have no other; for we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their Nature ſo imperfectly, that we are not able to frame a Language on purpoſe to expreſs it; and he who ſhould go about ſuch a work, would neither be underſtood by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nor well known what he meant him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But of all Beings, God himſelf is ſo far above our comprehenſion, that we can never ſpeak of him in expreſſions ſuitable to his Divine Nature, and therefore when true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Reaſons then, why God is often ſpoken of in the Scriptures, after the manner in which we are wont to ſpeak of men, may be reduced to theſe particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The uſe of Metaphorical and Figurative expreſſions is uſual in all Languages, and no Language is ſufficient to ſet forth the Majeſty and Attributes of God.</p>

                        <hi>Maimonides</hi> has proved from the propriety of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> words, that the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Likeneſs</hi> of God, in which man is ſaid to have been made, is to be underſtood of the faculties of his Mind; and he lays this down as a general and known rule amongſt the Jews, <hi>Loquitur Lex ſecundum linguam Filiorum homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> and he likewiſe obſerves that both <hi>On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelos</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> have in their Paraphraſes taken care to give the true ſenſe of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, as ſeem to imply any thing corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real in God. The Scriptures make mention of his eyes, and hands and feet, to expreſs the effects of thoſe Actions, which are performed by men with theſe members: and when it was ſaid, <hi>it repented the Lord that he had
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61773:367"/>made man on the Earth, and it grieved him at his heart,</hi> Gen. 6.6. This was well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to mean no more than that God acted, as men are wont to do, when they change their minds, and repent and grieve at what they have done, and that he would certainly deſtroy the world which he had made: for <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf inſtructs the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that God is without any bodily ſhape or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and therefore cannot be ſaid to have any heart, or to be grieved at his heart in the ſame ſenſe, that it is ſaid of men. And <hi>Num.</hi> 23.19. it is declared, that <hi>God is not a man, that he ſhould lye, neither the Son of man; that he ſhould repent.</hi> And when God ſays that <hi>it repented him that he had ſet up Saul to be King,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.11. this is explain'd <hi>v.</hi> 29. where we read, that <hi>the ſtrength of Iſrael will not lye, nor repent; for he is not a man that he ſhould repent:</hi> and yet again in the laſt verſe it is ſaid, that <hi>the Lord repented, that he had made Saul King over Iſrael.</hi> The moſt careleſs wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could not ſo ſoon and ſo often forget himſelf: but what is ſaid of Gods repenting, is to be taken in an improper and figurative ſenſe, to imply that God would act in that caſe, as men act when they repent of what they have done, tho without any change of mind, or any grief, or other paſſion in him at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it: the effect was the ſame as if God had repented, and therefore by a <hi>Metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> the effect is expreſt by that which in men
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61773:368"/>is wont to be the cauſe of ſuch effects, tho repentance was not the cauſe of it; but the reaſon and ſtate of the caſe, which he had fully known and conſidered from all eternity, and therefore could not be ſurprized, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to any alteration of Judgment by it. <hi>His ſoul was grieved for the miſery of Iſrael,</hi> Judg. 10.16. or, it was <hi>ſhortned,</hi> as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word is literally tranſlated in the Margin, that is, according to

                        <hi>Maimonides,</hi> the Lords mind was ſhortened from afflicting them, or he had no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a mind to puniſh them. When God is ſaid to ſee, the meaning is, that he knows what is done; when he is ſaid to hear, this ſignifies, that he underſtands what is ſaid.

God ſays, that he could not deſtroy <hi>Sodom</hi> till <hi>Lot</hi> was eſcaped out of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.22. and to <hi>Moſes</hi> he ſays, <hi>Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot againſt them, and that I may conſume them,</hi> Exod. 32.10. But we muſt not imagin that the Reaſons and Motives which <hi>Moſes</hi> there repreſents to God in his prayer in behalf of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> could prevail more with him, than his own infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs, or that he could not have preſerved <hi>Lot</hi> in the midſt of <hi>Sodom,</hi> as well as he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> out of the Fiery Furnace. But theſe things are thus expreſt for an encouragement in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to teach us dependance upon God; for the righteous <hi>have power with God</hi> as well as <hi>with men,</hi> and ſhall <hi>prevail, Gen.</hi> 32.28.

                     <p>The ſumm of all is, that to give the more Force and Life to the Diſcourſes of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and to render them the more effectual to the ends, for which they were deſigned, God, who is by the infinite excellency of his Nature, uncapable of any Paſſion, is pleas'd to be repreſented as ſubject to Love, and Anger, and Hatred, and all the Paſſions of Humanity; and He, who knows perfectly all events from Eternity, is contented even to ſeem ſometimes to doubt of the effects of his deſigns and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, and of the events of humane Actions; to ſhew, as

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61773:369"/>not that the Divine Nature can be capable of Anger, or Grief, or Rejoycing, which imply change and imperfection, and therefore muſt be impoſſible in the moſt abſolutely perfect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but becauſe Men are wont to be angry, when they puniſh, and to be grieved when thoſe do amiſs whom they would have do well, and are wont to rejoice when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to reform; therefore to ſet forth, that God will certainly puniſh unrepenting Sinners, and receive the returning Penitent, and reward the Righteous, both the Goodneſs and Juſtice of God are explain'd in ſuch terms; as may moſt move and affect Men, to ſhew that the puniſhments he inflicts, will in the end be as grievous, as if he receiv'd ſome loſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment by the obſtinacy of the Wicked; and that he will as bountifully reward the Good, as if they had done him ſome great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and kindneſs, and had made ſome addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his own Joy and Happineſs, which is infinite and eternal, and therefore uncapable of any.</p>

But it ſeems they had a more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable opportunity than they expected of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing there: and tho this happened beyond expectation, yet the Sacred Hiſtorian is ſo punctuallas to acquaint us with that ſign which was given by an agreement made between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> when they ſuppoſed that it would not have been ſafe for them to come to one another, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.</p>

Whoever would either delight or profit, muſt ſpeak and act in ſome meaſure according to the genius of the people with whom he converſes: and if we will but read the Scriptures, with the ſame candour and reſpect with which we read the Writings of Human Authors, and conſider the Times, and Perſons, and the Occaſions upon which they were written, there is nothing that can ſeem harſh or improper either in the words or actions of the perſons inſpired (for it was the manner of thoſe Countries to ſpeak by their

                     <p>In many Books of the Scriptures the ſtyle is ſublime and elegant, beyond any thing to be found in other Writings, and yet as natural as if it could not have been otherwiſe expreſt; and this is the true excellency of ſtyle, that it be plain and natural, and yet eloquent. <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus</hi> gives a high character of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s ſtyle in a Book, the deſign whereof is to repreſent the moſt perfect Idea of Eloquence: indeed ſuch is the fitneſs both in Verſe and Proſe of the words and ſtyle of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo admirably ſuited to the ſubject upon all occaſions, as if he had been to preſcribe a pattern of true Eloquence, as well as to enact Laws. <hi>H.

For the Spirit, and Genius, and peculiar Idioms of moſt Tongues being ſo very different one from another, and depending upon the Cuſtoms and Humours of the people of ſeveral Countries, it was the evident care and providence of God, to cauſe great part of the Scriptures, tho written by ſo many different men, and at ſuch diſtant times, and ſome Books of them in the earlier Ages of the World, to be penned in ſuch a language and ſtyle, as is moſt natural, and which without any want of Art exceeds the moſt artificial and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died Eloquence in ſublime and noble thoughts and expreſſions, and in all the beauties and ornaments of Speech: and yet, which in all the neceſſary points of Salvation is eaſie to be underſtood, under all the diſadvantages of a Verbal Tranſlation, by men of ordinary capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, who live ſo many Ages after. The Propheſies of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> cannot be read, or heard,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61773:377"/>or thought of without being moved by them: with what Life then, with what Zeal and Flame muſt they have been delivered? And what a mighty Bleſſing was ſuch a Prophet to his own Age, and to all ſucceeding Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Of Royal Blood, and of a Style and Behaviour ſuitable to his Birth; of Divine Virtues, and of Divine Eloquence! He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares things, which were not to be fulfilled till many Ages afterwards, as plainly as if he had ſeen them before his eyes, and would make all others to ſee them; he ſpeaks of Chriſt as clearly, as if with <hi>Simeon</hi> he had had his Saviour in his arms, or with the Wiſe men had been kneeling down before him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting him with more precious Gifts than any they had to offer; and deſcribes his Paſſion as fully, as if he had followed him through every part of it, and having been Crucified with him, had been juſt entring with him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Paradice. If this be thought a Digreſſion from my ſubject, I hope it may eaſily be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed: for who can ſpeak of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Digreſſion, when men chooſe the food of Swine, and trample upon Pearls, as things of no value, as if he and the other Prophets had always the hard fate to preach to <hi>the Rulers of</hi> Sodom, and <hi>the People of</hi> Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rha.</p>

Yet it was fit that other parts of the Scriptures ſhould have the bare force and evidence of truth only, to convince men, that it might appear that our Religion was propagated not by any Arts of humane Eloquence, but by its own Worth and Excellency: For Eloquence was not uſed, where it would have been moſt neceſſary, if any humane means could be ſo, in aſſerting and propagating the Divine Truth. In the propagation of the Goſpel all the Eloquence, as well as the Power, and Prejudices, and Vices of Mankind were combined againſt it, and yet leſs elegancy and accuracy of ſtyle was employed by the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, than had been before uſed by <hi>Moſes</hi> and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>WHatever uncertainty there can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be, concerning the Canon of the Holy Scriptures, or the Catalogue and Number of Books of Divine Revelation, this ought to be made no objection againſt the certainty of Divine Revelation itſelf, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the authority of thoſe Books of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which are univerſally acknowledged and received by all Churches. For if this be a true way of arguing, then whatever we are ignorant of, muſt be an argument againſt the certainty of what we know; and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence no man can be certain of any thing, ſince the wiſeſt man is ignorant of ſo many
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61773:379"/>things, that he knows very little in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of what he is ignorant of. And as to the matter in hand, there is ſcarce any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of great note and fame, but that Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks have had Diſputes concerning the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his genuine Works; and yet this has never been thought any prejudice to ſuch as are allowed by all to be genuine. Would not that man make himſelf ridiculous, who ſhould reject the <hi>Philippicks</hi> of <hi>Tully,</hi> or <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Aeneis,</hi> as ſpurious, becauſe other Books, either doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or counterfeit, have paſt under the names of theſe two Authors? If ſome Books have been diſputed, the reſt certainly are genuine beyond all diſpute, becauſe they have never been called into queſtion or doubt.</p>
                     <p>Now if theſe Books only were of Divine Revelation, concerning which there has never been any Diſpute, they contain all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be believed and practiſed; and as to the reſt, concerning which there has been any controverſy, tho they be exceeding uſeful to explain divers things, which we find in theſe, and perhaps to teach us ſome things (not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to our Religion, nor neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) which are not to be found elſewhere: yet they are not abſolutely neceſſary to be received, becauſe whatever Doctrines are abſolutely neceſſary, they are to be found fully and plainly delivered in thoſe Books of Scripture, which have ever been received without contradiction or diſpute. Many men were undoubtedly
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61773:380"/>ſaved, before the writing of theſe controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Books, nay, before the writing of any Books at all; Writings being no further neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, than as they are neceſſary to convey the knowledge of what is written, when the things now written could be as well known without writing, Books were not neceſſary: and tho for after ages it became neceſſary, that the Prophets and Apoſtles and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts ſhould conſign their Doctrine to writing, yet no more of their writings can be abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to be known by us, than what may be ſufficient to inſtruct us in the ways of ſalvation. It is the infinite Goodneſs and Mercy of God to afford us more than is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for our ſpiritual and eternal Life, as he has done for our Natural, and it is a great ſin in any man to reject any means of Salvation or Inſtruction, which God has been pleaſed to allow: but ſtill that man would ſuſtain his Natural Life and Health, who ſhould think all, that is not neceſſary to the ſupport of it, <hi>common</hi> or <hi>unclean,</hi> and not fit to be uſed for food. And if a man without any of his own fault or neglect ſhould come to the knowledge only of the uncontrroverted Books, he would find them abundantly ſufficient to anſwer all the ends of Revelation, and to procure his Salvation. It cannot be denied but that one infallible Authority is as great a Security, as never ſo many could be: but the ſame Doctrines are taught in ſeveral places
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61773:380"/>of Scripture, and we ought to be thankful to God for it, that he has been pleaſed to furniſh us with ſo much more than is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, and to repeat the ſame things in ſundry places and in divers manners, for our further inſtruction and confirmation in the Faith: tho it would be abſurd and wicked to ſay, that he who believes all the points of neceſſary Faith, upon the authority of any one Book of Scripture, has no ſufficient means of Salvation, unleſs he likewiſe believe them upon the Authority of all the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Not that I ſuppoſe any wiſe and good man can now find any cauſe to doubt of any Book in the Old or New Teſtament, whether it be genuine or no; but to ſuppoſe the moſt and the worſt that can be ſuppoſed, if thoſe Books which at any time have been called in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were not only dubious, but certainly ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, the remaining Books, which were never doubted of, are ſufficient for all the neceſſary ends and purpoſes of a Revelation: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ought to be no objection againſt the Authority of the Scriptures, that the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſome Books has been formerly matter of controverſy.</p>

Both Proteſtants and Papiſts are, generally ſpeaking, agreed, that the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets in the Old Teſtament, and the Writings of the Evangeliſts and the Apoſtles in the New are of Divine Authority; and if this be ſo, the Chriſtian Religion muſt be true, whether there be, or be not others of the ſame nature, and of equal authority. Theſe Books in the main have already been proved to be genuine, and without any material corruption or alteration. I ſhall now only propoſe ſuch general conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, as may be ſufficient to obviate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
                     <p>The agreement between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans</hi> in the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> is a clear evidence for its Authority. And tho there were many and great Idolatries committed in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Judah,</hi> yet by the good providence of God there never was ſuch a total Apoſtacy in the people, nor ſo long a ſucceſſion of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Kings, as that the Books, either of the Law or the Prophets, can be ſuppoſed to have been ſuppreſt or altered. <hi>For three years</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Rehoboam, they walked in the way of David and Solomon,</hi> 2 Chron. 11.17.12.1. and tho afterwards he <hi>forſook the Law of the Lord, and all Iſrael with him,</hi> his Reign was in all but ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61773:381"/>years. <hi>Abijam</hi> was a wicked King, but he reigned no longer than three years, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> xv. 2. <hi>Aſa</hi> the third from <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> his Son, were great Reformers; and <hi>Aſa</hi> reigned one and forty years, and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhaphat</hi> five and twenty years, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xvi. 13. xx. 31. The two next Kings in ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did evil in the ſight of the Lord, but their Reigns were ſhort, <hi>Jehoram</hi> reigned eight years, and <hi>Ahaziah</hi> but one, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxi. 20. xxii. 2. During the interval of ſix years un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the uſurpation of <hi>Athaliah,</hi> the people could not be greatly corrupted: for ſhe was hateful to them, as <hi>Jehoram</hi> her husband had been before her, and they readily joyned with <hi>Jehoiada</hi> in ſlaying her, and in reſtoring the worſhip of God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxii. <hi>Joaſh</hi> the ſon of <hi>Ahaziah did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord all the days of Jehoiada,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxiv. 2.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61773:382"/>invading the Prieſts office, the adminiſtration of affairs was in the hands of his Son <hi>Jotham,</hi> verſ. 21. who imitated the good part of his fathers Reign, Chap. xxvii. 2. <hi>Ahaz</hi> was wicked and an Idolater, but he reigned only ſixteen years, Chap. xxviii. 1. and his ſon <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> wrought a great Reformation, who reigned twenty nine years, Chap. xxix. 1. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes</hi> was much given to Idolatry in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of his Reign, but after his captivity in <hi>Babylon</hi> he was very zealous againſt it, Chap. xxxiii. 15, 16. <hi>Amon</hi> imitated the ill part of his Father's Reign, but his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued no longer than two years, Chap. xxxiii. 21. The next was <hi>Joſiah,</hi> in whoſe time the Book of the Law was found in the Temple, which muſt be the Book of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s own hand-writing; for it is evident, that a Book of the Law could be no ſuch rare thing at that time in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as to be taken ſo much no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, unleſs it had been that Book, which was laid up in the ſide of the Ark, and was to be tranſcribed by every King. It ſeems, that Book of the Law had been purpoſely hid, to preſerve it from the attempts of Idolaters, who it was feared might have a deſign to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it: for if it had only lain by neglected, the finding of it could have been no ſuch ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing thing, becauſe the place in the Temple was well known, where it was wont to be kept in the ſide of the Ark, and where they might have ſought for it: but it was proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61773:382"/>at that time ſuppoſed to have been utterly loſt, and its being found in the Ruines of the Temple, which was built for the obſervation of it, and where it ought to have been kept with the greateſt care, as a moſt ineſtimable treaſure; the veneration which <hi>Joſiah</hi> had for ſo ſacred a Writing, and the happy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected recovery of it, when it had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded and almoſt loſt, through the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Predeceſſors; theſe conſiderations could not but exceedingly move a mind ſo tender and affectionately pious as that Kings, when he received the Law under <hi>Moſes</hi>'s own hand, ſent him, as he believed by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and delivered to him, as it were, anew from Heaven. Not long after his time was the Captivity in <hi>Babylon;</hi> till which there were always Prophets, frequent Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and never any ſucceſſion of Idolatrous Kings, which continued for a long time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; very few Kings were Idolatrous through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their whole Reigns, and thoſe that were, reigned but a ſhort time.</p>

Tho it ſhould be granted that ſome Books, which were written by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, are now loſt, it is no abſurdity to ſuppoſe that God ſhould ſuffer Writings to be loſt, thro the fault and negligence of men, which were dictated by his Spirit. Several things might by the Prophets be delivered by Revelation to the perſons whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, which were never committed to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and others, which were written, but which were not neceſſary to the ends of Revelation in general, but rather concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed particular times and places, and the ſubſtance whereof, as far as the world in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is concerned, is to be found in the other Scriptures, might by the careleſneſs of men never come to the ſight and knowledge of Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>And here I ſhall obſerve, that the Books of Prophecy have always the Names of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors expreſt, and commonly they are often repeated in the Books themſelves, but in the Hiſtorical Books there was not the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it; becauſe in matters of fact, which are paſt, an Author may eaſily be diſproved,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61773:386"/>if he relates what is falſe of his own times, or of times whereof there are memorials ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. But the Credit of Prophecies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things to come, a long time after, to paſs, muſt depend upon the Miſſion and Authority of the Prophet only, and therefore it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the Names of the Prophets ſhould be annext, that their Predictions might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon, when they were known to be delivered by men, who by other Predictions already fulfilled, had proved themſelves to be true Prophets.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. The very preſervation of Books of ſo great Antiquity, thro ſo many changes and revolutions, againſt all the injuries of Time and Ignorance, againſt the violence of War and the malice of Adverſaries, and ſo many other Accidents, which have deſtroyed moſt other Books of any conſiderable Antiquity, is a certain indication of a wonderful Providence concerned for them, and of that evidence whereby they were at firſt atteſted. The Laws of the wiſeſt Law-givers of the moſt flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and powerful Nations have been ſo little regarded by the people to whom they were given, that they ſoon forſook the practice of them, and readily delivered up themſelves to be governed by other Laws, upon any Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; and all the pretences to Revelation, which moſt of the Ancient Law-givers aſſumed to themſelves, could make them no longer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to, nor ſo much valued, as to outlive
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61773:387"/>the fate of the particular Kingdoms and States for which they were contrived: but moſt of them were changed or laid aſide before, and the reſt given up and abandoned, as out of date, and of little uſe or eſteem afterwards, and all of them were ſo little able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the deſtruction of time, that we know not much more of them, than that the beſt and moſt ancient were in great meaſure taken out of the Laws of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets have continued entire and unchanged under all accidents and revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of affairs, bearing this character as well as others of him, who is immutable; they have been ſtill aſſerted againſt all the malice and oppoſition of Enemies by a capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and diſperſed people, who by the ſignal providence of God, tho they reject their <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> yet ſtill acknowledge thoſe propheſies, which foretold his coming, and after their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion for ſo many hundred years, are ſo far from renouncing them, that they aſſert and maintain them, and are zealous even to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, for thoſe Books, which command that worſhip, and appoint thoſe Solemnities, which they have ſo long been out of all poſſibility to obſerve, as if thoſe Laws, which were once ſo uneaſy to their Fore-fathers, were now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come natural to their Poſterity, or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were revealed by him, whoſe word ſhall never paſs away till all be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>

The reſpect that hath been always had to the Writings of the New Teſtament, without in ſerting any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble additions therein, is an evident proof that all people have looked upon them as Divine Books, which it is not lawful for any to alter.

Tho the Authority of ſome Books hath been queſtioned by private men, yet thoſe Books were never rejected by any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Church, tho frequent Councils were called in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, and had this very thing under conſideration.

As to the Authority of the particular Apoſtolical Canon, which contains the Canon of Scripture, of the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> gives a ſufficient Teſtimony to it, ſo far as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Books of the New Teſtament; and ſhews wherein it has been corrupted ſince. All which very well agrees with that which I obſerved from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that frequent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils were called in the firſt Ages, and that they had the Canon of Scripture among other things under conſideration, which we find ſet down in the laſt of the Apoſtles Canons, and from thence, in the Canons of the Council of <hi>Laodicea;</hi> no Book being omitted but the <hi>Revelation</hi> of St <hi>John,</hi> which yet had been acknowledged and received as Authentick from the beginning of thoſe who had moſt reaſon to know of what Authority it was; but none were inſerted into the Canon, but ſuch Books as were appointed to be conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read in the Aſſemblies of Chriſtians. It appears then that the Canon of Scripture was finiſhed by St <hi>John,</hi> and that ſuch Books as were not of Divine Authority were rejected, by Councils held, when there were living Witneſſes to certify St <hi>John</hi>'s Approbation of the Canon, or at leaſt thoſe, who had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it from ſuch Witneſſes; the Goſpels of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61773:394"/>the other Evangeliſts were tranſlated into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Languages in St <hi>John</hi>'s Life time, and we muſt in reaſon ſuppoſe the ſame of the other Books of Scripture; this is certain that they were all very early tranſlated into many Tongues, and diſperſed into ſo many Hands, in ſo many Countries, that it was impoſſible they ſhould be either loſt or falſifyed, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cially ſince the ſeveral ſects of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were never more jealous and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over each other in any thing than in this particular, the ſeveral Intereſts and Pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all parties being chiefly concerned in it, and no Catalogue of Books could have been received excluſively to all others, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the cleareſt evidence.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. When it once appeared, that the Books, which had been doubted of, belonged to the Canon of Scripture, they were afterwards ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally acknowledged, and conſtantly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in all Churches: every Sect has ſince uſed all Arts and Endeavours to reconcile the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to their own Doctrines; few or none preſuming to reject the Authority of any of theſe Books, which they would never ſcruple to do, if they ſuppos'd they could make out any plauſible pretence for it. Proteſtants have refuſed to admit of the Apocryphal Books, as inſpired; but whoever have gone about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject any part of the Canonical Scriptures, have been univerſally declared againſt for it: whereof no other reaſon can be given, but the Evidence, that is for the Authority of the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61773:394"/>Canonical Books of Scripture, which is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Authority of the Apocryphal Books. Papiſts own the Authority of the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and of the fourteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that Epiſtle, which is directly againſt praying in an unknown Tongue; and they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians</hi> to be genuine, tho the ſecond Chapter be ſo clearly againſt the pretenſions of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe Eſpiſtles indeed were never controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> likewiſe is not rejected by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> the Divine Nature of Chriſt and the Merit and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his ſufferings are ſo plainly aſſerted in it; and they dare not deny the Authority of the Goſpel and Epiſtles of St <hi>John,</hi> tho they are ſo hard put to it, to expound them to their own ſenſe, that <hi>Socinus</hi> was forc'd to pretend to I know not what Revelation to help out one of his explications, which he would not have done, if he could have found out any colour for not admitting the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Text, ſo directly contrary to his own Tenents, that he could not expect, that any thing leſs than a Revelation ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure any credit to his Interpretation. And generally the caſe is the ſame with other Sects: thoſe that differ never ſo much one from another in the Interpretation of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Texts, yet agree in the acknowledgment of the Authority of the Canon of Scripture itſelf, or can find out no ſufficient pretence to diſown it.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>IT is to be obſerv'd, that an extrardinary Providence has in a great meaſure ſecur'd the Holy Scriptures from thoſe Caſualties which are incident to humane Writings. For the great Antiquity of many Books of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, beyond that of any other Books in the World, the multitude of Copies, which have been taken in all Ages and Nations, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to avoid miſtakes in tranſcribing Books, in a Language which has ſo many of its Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and of its Words themſelves ſo like one another, the defect of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Vowels, and the late invention (as it is generally now acknowledged) of the Points, the change of the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> or ancient <hi>Hebrew</hi> for the preſent <hi>Hebrew</hi> Character, the captivity of the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> for ſeventy years, and the mixtures and changes, which were during that time, brought into their Language; in ſhort, all the accidents which have ever happened to occaſion errors or miſtakes in any Book, have concurred to cauſe them in the Old Teſtament; and yet the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Readings are much fewer, and make
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61773:395"/>much leſs alteration in the ſenſe, than thoſe of any other Book of the ſame bigneſs, and of any Note and Antiquity, if all the Copies ſhould be carefully examined, and every little variation as punctually ſet down, as thoſe of the Scriptures have been. But tho from hence it may appear, that a peculiar provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has been concerned in the preſervation of the Books of the Scriptures, yet from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane conſiderations and arguments, we may likewiſe be aſſured, that nothing prejudicial to the Authority of the Scriptures has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by any of theſe means.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The defect in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Vowels, and the late Invention of the Points is no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the Authority of the Bible, as we now have it. Tho the Points, which criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically determine the exact Reading of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, be of a later invention, yet that Tongue was never without its Vowels. For <hi>Aleph, Vau,</hi> and <hi>Jod,</hi> and (which ſome add) <hi>He</hi> and <hi>Gnajm,</hi> before the invention of the Points, were uſed as Vowels, as it is evidently proved from <hi>Joſephus,
<note place="margin">Vid. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. Prolegom. iii. ſ. 49.</note> Origen,</hi> and St <hi>Jerom,</hi> by the beſt Criticks in that Language. It muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be confeſt, that theſe Vowels could not be ſo effectual to aſcertain the true Reading, as the Points have ſince been, but whatever defect there might be in the Vowels, it was ſupplied by conſtant uſe and practice, and by ſome general Rules, which they obſerved in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61773:396"/>the Reading. The Bible being a Book which by Divine Commandment was ſo often and carefully read both in publick and private, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text might be exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read, and the true ſenſe certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd and known; and it is no wonder, that by conſtant uſe and continual practice and cuſtom from their infancy, the <hi>Jews</hi> could read it with eaſe and readineſs without Points, which is no more than is ordinarily done now by men, who are skilful in that Language, and divers have attain'd to it by their own obſervation and induſtry.

In ſome things of leſs conſequence the Tranſlators might be miſtaken, or they might follow a different Copy.</p>
                     <p>The Authority of the Text of Scripture is greatly confirmed from the citations of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers, from whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that in the ſeveral Ages of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Churches, the Copies which they made uſe of had no ſuch variations from thoſe we now uſe, as to be of any ill conſequence in matters of Religion.</p>
                     <p>As to the Imputation that was charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Jews</hi> by ſome of the Fathers, that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61773:399"/>they had corrupted the Scriptures in ſuch places, as according to the Tranſlation of the Septuagint, and the ſenſe of their Anceſtors muſt prove the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion againſt them; this is to be underſtood of the Verſions of <hi>Aquila, Symmachus,</hi> and <hi>Theodoſian,</hi> who being all either profeſt <hi>Jews,</hi> or Judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Hereticks, deſigned their Tranſlations to countenance their own errors, eſpecially <hi>Aquila,</hi> who undertook his Verſion, purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to oppoſe that of the Septuagint.

And as many Sects and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions as there are amongſt Chriſtians, and as many different Tranſlations as they make uſe of, they all acknowledge the Authority of the originals, and their Tranſlations in the main are the ſame, however they diſagree in rendring ſome particular paſſages, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the different opinions of the ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and upon that account maintain their own Tranſlation to be more correct than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

                     <p n="6">VI. And no leſs may be ſaid in behalf of the New Teſtament than of the Old; for the Books of it were kept from the beginning as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Treaſure, with great care and reverence, and were conſtantly read in the Chriſtian Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, and ſoon tranſlated into all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages. The Primitive Chriſtians choſe to undergo any Torments, rather than they would deliver up the Books of Scripture to their Perſecutors to be deſtroyed, and they were no leſs careful to preſerve them uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by Hereticks. Beſides, when Hereticks attempted to corrupt any Text of Scripture to ſerve their particular Hereſies, they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt not only by the Orthodox, but by other Hereticks, who were not concerned for thoſe opinions, in behalf whereof the corruption was intended. So that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any corruptions to be impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Church, or to paſs undiſcovered even by ſome of the Hereticks themſelves. They muſt be deſigned for ſome end, and to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize ſome particular Doctrines, and then all, who were not for thoſe Doctrines, and more eſpecially thoſe who were againſt them, would certainly oppoſe ſuch corruptions.</p>
                     <p>The agreement likewiſe of the <hi>Greek</hi> Text of the New Teſtament, with the ſeveral an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Verſions, and with the quotations found in the Writings of the Fathers, who cited and alledged them from the times of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, proves that there have been no alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61773:402"/>of any ſuch conſequence as to make the Scriptures inſufficient for the ends of a Divine Revelation. If any man be of another opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, let him inſtance in any one Article of Faith, or Rule of Life, which cannot be proved from the Scriptures. It is not enough for him to ſhew, that ſome one or more Texts, which have been brought in proof of it, are diſputed, but he muſt ſhew that it can be proved by no Text, which is clear and undiſputed.</p>
                     <p>The various Lections of the Holy Scriptures are ſo far from being an Argument againſt their Authority, that they rather help to prove it, ſince they are comparatively ſo few in a Book of ſo great Antiquity. For no care and regard, inferiour to that, which we muſt ſuppoſe men to have of a Book, which they are convinced is of Divine Authority, could have produced a leſs variety of Readings in a Book of much leſs Antiquity. They are all of no conſequence to the prejudice of the end and deſign of a Revelation; and therefore they come under the number of ſuch Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, as God cannot be obliged in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to prevent. But the Bible could not without the ſignal providence of God, have been preſerved for ſo many ages, under ſo many changes and revolutions, which the Wiſdom of God, for reaſons elſewhere ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſaw fit to permit, much leſs could it have eſcaped with ſo inconſiderable variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

                     <p n="2">II. The differences in Chronology do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that there was any Chronological miſtake made by the Pen-men of the Holy Scriptures, but they ariſe from the miſtakes of Tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or Expoſitors. To be convinced of this we need only reflect a little upon ſome of thoſe things, which are apt to cauſe miſtakes in the Computations of Chronology; and it will ſoon appear, how unreaſonable it is to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin, that no Book can be of Divine Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is not ſitted to ſecure men from
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61773:406"/>the errors, which it is natural for them to commit in things of that intricacy.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Many difficulties in Chronology are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by not obſerving, that that which had been ſaid before in the general is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards reſumed and delivered in the particulars contained under it. For the total ſumm of any term of years being ſet down firſt, before the particulars have been inſiſted upon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, has led ſome into miſtakes, by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, that the particulars afterwards men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned were not to be comprehended in it, but to be reckoned apart, as if they had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened afterwards in order of Time, becauſe they are laſt related in the courſe of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Thus <hi>Gen.</hi> xi. 26. it is ſaid that <hi>Terah lived ſeventy years and begat Abram;</hi> and verſ. 32. that <hi>the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.</hi> But <hi>Gen.</hi> xii. 4. it is written that <hi>Abram was ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and five years old when he departed out of Haran:</hi> which is inconſiſtent, if we ſuppoſe that <hi>Abram</hi> lived in <hi>Haran</hi> till the Death of his Father <hi>Terah:</hi> but if we conſider that the whole number of years which <hi>Terah</hi> lived is ſet down <hi>Gen.</hi> xi. 32. and that the departure of <hi>Abram</hi> out of <hi>Haran,</hi> which is related <hi>Gen.</hi> xii. yet happened before his Fathers Death, there will be no inconſiſtency; but it will be evident, if <hi>Terah</hi> was but ſeventy years old when <hi>Abram</hi> was begotten, and <hi>Abram</hi> was but ſeventy five years old when he went out
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61773:406"/>of <hi>Haran,</hi> that <hi>Abram</hi> left his Father <hi>Terah</hi> in <hi>Haran,</hi> where he lived after <hi>Abram</hi>'s departure from him to the age of two hundred and five years. Tho during his Father's life he did upon occaſion return to <hi>Haran.</hi> For the final removal of <hi>Abram</hi> was not till the death of his Father, as we learn from <hi>Acts</hi> vii. 4. And if this way of relating that in General firſt, which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſet forth in the Particulars, be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to in the Interpretation of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, it will afford a Solution of many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; as
<note n="*" place="margin">Aug. Qu. Sup. Genef. c. 25.</note> St <hi>Auſtin</hi> has obſerved, which otherwiſe are inexplicable. Others ſuppoſe <hi>Abrant</hi> was the youngeſt of <hi>Terah</hi>'s Sons, tho mentioned firſt, and then there is no difficulty in the Chronology; only by this and other inſtances we may obſerve that the eldeſt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not always placed firſt in Scripture, but ſometimes the youngeſt, out of reſpect to him, for his favour with God, and his greater dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and worth: and therefore whatever dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties in Chronology ariſe upon this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that the Son firſt named muſt therefore neceſſarily be firſt born, proceed from a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Sometimes the principal number is ſet down, and the odd or leſſer number is omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which being added to the great or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal number in ſome other place, cauſes a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference not to be reconciled, but by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is cuſtomary in the beſt Authors
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61773:407"/>not always to mention the leſſer numbers, where the matter doth not require it. And we have evident proof of this in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. The time of the ſojourning of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and of their dwelling in <hi>Egypt</hi> is ſaid to be the ſpace of four hundred years, <hi>Gen.</hi> xv. 13. <hi>Acts</hi> vii. 6. which yet was in all four hundred and thirty years, <hi>Exod.</hi> xii. 40. <hi>Galat.</hi> iii. 17. The <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> are computed to be <hi>ſix hundred thouſand and three thouſand and five hundred and fifty,</hi> Num. i. 46. ii. 32. but <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking of them, <hi>Num.</hi> xi. 21. leaves out the three thouſand and five hundred and fifty. <hi>Jerubbual</hi> or <hi>Gideon</hi> is ſaid to have had <hi>threeſcore and ten</hi> Sons by his Wives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Abimelech,</hi> whom he had by a Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, <hi>Judg.</hi> viii. 30, 31. and <hi>Abimelech</hi> is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſaid to have ſlain theſe threeſcore and ten brethren, tho <hi>Jotham</hi> the youngeſt of them is at the ſame time ſaid to have eſcaped, <hi>Judg.</hi> ix. 5, 18, 24, 56. The <hi>Benjamites</hi> that were ſlain, <hi>Judg.</hi> 20.35. are ſaid to be <hi>twenty and five thouſand and an hundred men,</hi> whereas verſ. 46. they are reckoned only twenty and five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 5. we read that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was <hi>ſeen of Cephas, then of the twelve,</hi> tho St <hi>Matthias</hi> was not choſen into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Apoſtles till after the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, and St <hi>Mark</hi> ſays preciſely that <hi>he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto the eleven as they ſat at meat,</hi> Mark

                     <p n="3">3. Sometimes an <hi>Epocha</hi> may be miſtaken by Chronologers: as <hi>Gen.</hi> vi. 3. <hi>And the Lord ſaid my Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man: for that he alſo is fleſh, yet his days ſhall be an hundred and twenty years.</hi> But from <hi>Gen.</hi> v. 32. compared with <hi>Gen.</hi> viii. 13. the Flood muſt happen but an hundred years after theſe words ſeem to have been ſpoken: tho if we compute not from the time, when this was threatned,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61773:408"/>but from the beginning of Man's Apoſtacy, which we may ſuppoſe then to have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Twenty years, there will be no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it.

                     <p n="4">4. Variations in Chronology may ſometimes proceed from the likeneſs of two words, which occaſioned the writing the one for the other. Thus <hi>Acts</hi> xiii. 20. ſome read. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. Some famous Copies, from whence moſt others now remaining may have been tranſcribed, might happen to be uncorrect in ſome of theſe leſs material parts of Scripture: the Numeral Letters were caſily miſtaken, as we ſee our Figures now are; and when they numbred by Letters, miſtakes might the oftner happen, becauſe the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers might unawares write down a Letter of the foregoing or following Word inſtead of the true Numeral Letter, when there was any likeneſs between them; and the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being ſome of them ſo very much alike, might be a readier occaſion of miſtake.

                     <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of the Obſcurity of ſome Places in the Scriptures, particularly of the Types and Propheſies.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>HEre it muſt in the firſt place be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that it has been a common and true obſervation, that all Authors are rather perplex'd and obſcured, than explained by a multitude of Commentators; and this is ſo true of no Book as of the Scriptures: for as none has had ſo many Gloſſes and Comments put upon it by men of all Ages and Nations; ſo moſt of them endeavour to find out ſome new Explication, or to ſerve a Cauſe; and maintain ſome particular opinions by their Expoſitions. So that it is a wonder that any part of the Scriptures ſhould be clear, after Volumes have been written, I may truly ſay, upon every Text; rather than that difficulties ſhould be found in them. But at the ſame time it muſt be acknowledged, that we find it declared in the Scriptures themſelves, that there are places of difficulty in them: which makes it but ſo much the more unreaſonable that this ſhould be urged as an objection againſt them. For what is acknowledged and profeſt, muſt be ſuppos'd to be with a deſign,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:61773:411"/>and for ſome good reaſon, and the reaſon and deſign ought to be inquired into, before this be uſed as an objection. St <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt's coming to Judgment ſays, that St <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles had delivered <hi>ſome things hard to be underſtood;</hi> and St <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, that there had been miſtakes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he had written in this matter, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> ii. 1, 2, 3. St <hi>Peter</hi> on this occaſion ſays, that it ſo happened not only to St <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, but to other Books of the Scriptures, thro the ignorance and raſhneſs of <hi>unlearned</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable</hi> men, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 16. And it happens more eſpecially in thoſe places of Scripture, which are concerning things of this nature, or contain whatever Prophecies of things to come. Therefore I ſhall, I. give an account how it comes to paſs, that there are things hard to be underſtood in the Scriptures in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. II. I ſhall in particular conſider the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of Prophecies, and ſhall prove the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Types made uſe of by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſhew that there is great force and evidence in the Arguments brought from them. III. I ſhall prove that the obſcurity of ſome places of the Scriptures is no prejudice to the Authority of them, nor to the end and deſign of them.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. I ſhall give an account in general, how it comes to paſs, that there are ſome things in the Scriptures hard to be underſtood.</p>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:61773:412"/>
                     <p n="1">1. Some Doctrines, which it mightily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us to be acquainted withal, could not be delivered in ſo plain a manner, but that they muſt needs have great difficulties in them, as the Doctrine of the Bleſſed Trinity, of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of Chriſt, of the Reſurrection, and of the Joys of Heaven and of the Torments of Hell. There are ſeveral things which we are capable of knowing, and which are neceſſary to be known, of which yet we cannot have ſo perfect and abſolute a knowledge, but that ſomething of them will ſtill remain unknown to us. As there is no object more viſible, or better known to us than the Sun is; but to calculate the dimenſions and the diſtance of the Sun from us, to know how its light is communicated, and ſuddenly ſpread over the face of the Earth, are things of great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and can never perhaps be fully accounted for: In like manner, what the Scriptures deliver to us concerning the Nature of God, and the ſtate of the World to come, muſt needs have difficulties in it, tho we are never ſo well aſſured that there is a God and a future ſtate; becauſe theſe are things above our underſtandings; we may perfectly underſtand that there are ſuch things, but can have no full and clear conception of all that may be fit to be delivered to us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them. Nothing can be made plainer to us, than we are capable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, or than the Nature of it, and the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61773:412"/>portion our Faculties bear to it, will allow. God being incomprehenſible, whatever is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered concerning him, can never be without all difficulty, and whilſt we are in this world, we can never underſtand the ſtate of the next ſo fully, as we ſhall do hereafter. And theſe are difficulties which muſt be, unleſs the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the things, or our own Nature were different from what it is.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, the greateſt Myſteries in the Chriſtian Religion, ſo far as they are revealed, and ſo far as they are required to be known by us, contain no inexplicable difficulties: but if we will needs know more of the Myſteries of Religion than is revealed, and more than is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be known, no wonder if we meet with difficulties. What is meaut, for inſtance, by the Doctrine of the Trinity, is capable of being very well underſtood, as the oppoſers of this Doctrine muſt own, unleſs they will confeſs, that they oppoſe they know not what. He that ſays a thing is not true, knows what it is which he pretends not to be true, if he underſtands what he ſays. The thing then is known, tho there be difficulties in the explication, but the explication concerns the manner of exiſtence, not the truth of it. For that may certainly be, and we may certainly know it to be, which yet we know not how it ſhould be. And the Doctrine itſelf only is revealed, as neceſſary to be believed, not any particular explication of it. And if it can be
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61773:413"/>proved, that this is the Doctrine of Scripture, and it be plain to be underſtood what is meant by this Doctrine, as it is delivered in Scripture, this ſhews the plainneſs of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in all things neceſſary to Salvation, tho divers things relating to this Doctrine be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be explained, becauſe the Doctrine is plainly enough and intelligibly delivered, ſo far as it is required to be underſtood and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
                     <p>Several Arts and Sciences, which are very difficult and abſtruſe in the Theory, are eaſy in the Practice, and a man may very well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſtand what the <hi>Theorem</hi> itſelf is, which is to be proved, tho he be altogether uncapable of underſtanding the proof of it. Now, what God ſays, is as certain as any demonſtration can be, and what he has plainly delivered, is plain as well as certain; and it is never the leſs certain or plain, becauſe we cannot make out the proof of it, nor are able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how it can be. It is ſufficient that the Scriptures are plain in this Doctrine, ſo far as we are concerned to know it; it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that the Doctrine itſelf ſhould be plain in all the controverſies, which may be raiſed about it: when we know the meaning, we muſt take Gods word for the Truth of it. The manner of the diſtinction of Perſons and the Unity of Eſſence in the Godhead is not required to be believed, but the Thing, and we know the Thing to be ſo, becauſe God
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61773:413"/>himſelf has ſaid it, tho we can know nothing of the manner of it. We know the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is to be believed, tho we cannot make good the Proof of it in the way of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſoning, but only from the Authority of the Revealer, which is of it ſelf ſufficient, and ought to be inſtead of all other Reaſons to us.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Some parts of the Scriptures were fitted and accommodated to former Ages, and were more proper and uſeful for them, than if they had been written in ſuch a manner, as to be leſs obſcure and difficult. We may well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, that many parts of the Scriptures muſt have been more peculiarly adapted to their uſe and advantage, for whom they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately deſigned: and the Learning and Wiſdom of ancient Times conſiſted in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Proverbs and obſcure Forms of Speech, in <hi>Prophecies,</hi> in <hi>Subtil</hi> and <hi>Dark Parables,</hi> and in <hi>the ſecrets of grave Sentences, Eccl.</hi> xxxix. 1, 2, 3.

The Books of the Old Teſtament for the moſt part ſeem to have been the moſt plain, and the moſt eaſily intelligible of any Writings of ancient times; and they could not have been more obvious, but they muſt have been contemptible and uſeleſs to thoſe for whom they were immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned. The precepts and exhortations are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways plain and obvious, and the obſcurity of other things is ſo far from being an exception to the Books of Scripture, that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary according to the Learning and Cuſtoms of ancient times.</p>

                     <p>The Parables of our Bleſſed Saviour are explained to us, and there can now be no pretence of obſcurity in them; and in his Diſcourſes with the <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom they were not explained, he alluded to thoſe Proverbs and Cuſtoms, which were beſt known and moſt in uſe among them, to whom upon any occaſion he ſpoke; that thereby all, who <hi>had ears to hear,</hi> and were not by their ſins hindred from attending to what they heard, might be the more affected with them, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inclined to give themſelves up to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, when they heard him make uſe of ſuch Alluſions, as they knew, according to the way of teaching amongſt them, had ſome excellent hidden meaning, which they would be very deſirous to become acquainted withal.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Many places of Scripture, which are obſcure to us, were not obſcure in the ages in which they were written. (1.) Becauſe the obſcurity for the moſt part is rather in the form and manner of Speech, than in the notions themſelves; ſo that that might be clear at firſt, which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure to us, who are but little acquainted with the Phraſes and Idioms of the Language, and the Eloquence of thoſe Times and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. For the Faſhions of Speech vary as much as thoſe of the Garb and Habit, and the Eloquence and ways of Expreſſion are as different, as the Dialects and Languages of divers Ages and Nations. (2.) The names of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61773:415"/>Animals, of Flowers and Plants and Minerals are very liable to be miſtaken, and eſpecially whatever is peculiar to any Country, muſt needs be difficult to be underſtood by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, who have no ſuch things among them, and perhaps want words to expreſs their Nature, and can ſcarce have a true and exact notion of them. The preciſe value of Coins, and proportion of Weights and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures uſed ſo long ago, and in Countreys ſo far from ours, can hardly now be known, and muſt neceſſarily admit of great variety of opinions: there is much uncertainty about theſe in all ancient Hiſtory, but the great Antiquity of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hiſtory above others may make us reaſonably expect to find many more ſuch difficulties in it, and the different Names of the ſame Perſons, and of the ſame Places in the Scriptures is another occaſion of obſcurity. The Names, Coins, Weights, and Meaſures, and Habits of ancient times afford the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt work for Criticks, which were ſo well known, when the Authors who mention them, wrote, that it had been ridiculous for them to explain them. Theſe are difficulties of that Nature, that they could not be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but by the care and concernment of an extraordinary providence, and they are of ſo little moment, that it could not be expected, that God ſhould particularly concern himſelf to prevent them.</p>

                     <p n="3">(3.) The Penmen of the Scriptures, in their Proverbs or Parables, often allude to Cuſtoms, or to things, that happened in thoſe times, in which they lived, that were then commonly known, but being unknown now, may well make many places of their Writings obſcure to us, which were not ſo to thoſe of their own time. This is alledged as the reaſon of the obſcurity

And thus it is in all Books of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, eſpecially in ſuch Books as have frequent occaſion to hint at things ſo notorious at the time when they were written, that it was needleſs to give any particular account of them. This has made Notes and Comments neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary upon all Ancient Books, and thoſe places need them moſt, which treat of things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſo well known, that the Authors did not think fit to inſiſt upon them, but ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, and only alluded to them, rather than expreſt or explained them. For which reaſon we owe the Informations which we have of the <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities chiefly to <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, becauſe it had been abſurd for <hi>Romans,</hi> writing to men of their own City and Nation, to acquaint them with the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61773:416"/>of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they knew as well as themſelves; but thoſe things were proper for Foreigners to take notice of, for the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Foreigners. And whatever Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, either in Parables or otherwiſe, are made to ſuch things, muſt needs be difficult to us, becauſe whatever is thus ſpoken with reference to any thing, can be known no better than the thing itſelf; and that which ſerved for an Illuſtration at the firſt Writing, renders the ſenſe obſcure, when the thing uſed for Illuſtration, becomes unknown. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more generally known than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial Sayings of a Nation, to the people of it; but there is nothing that needs more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to Foreigners. And theſe Sayings are very frequent both in the diſcourſes of our Saviour, and throughout the whole Scriptures: for they are the moſt ſignificant and inſtructive way of Diſcourſe, and the moſt eaſily appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by ſuch as are uſed to them. The uſe of Proverbs is natural to all Nations, and they are the reſult of the experience and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of any people: So that the moſt effectual and readieſt way of Inſtruction is to apply theſe Sayings generally known and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, to particular caſes and occaſions. But then theſe commonly depend upon the cuſtoms of a people, or upon ſome Hiſtory, or particular Accident, and oftentimes are taken up at firſt upon ſmall occaſions, and the intention and ſignification of them is apt to be forgotten,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61773:417"/>or miſtaken in future Age, or by other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And therefore all places of Scripture, expreſt in Allegorical or Proverbial Forms of Speech, or by Types and Reſemblances of things, muſt needs have been better underſtood in thoſe times, when they were written, than they are now, becauſe we have but an imperfect Notion of many things, to which the Alluſion is made, or from whence the ſimilitude is taken, and the very thing which makes them now obſcure to us, made them the more plain and intelligible to them, who lived at the time of their being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>

Praef.</note> lays this down as a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Rule of the explication of the Scripture, that we ſhould attend to the main Scope any Deſign of Parables, and not inſiſt upon every word and circumſtance, which is added to make them more Natural, but not as any neceſſary part of them. And in thoſe Ages, when Prophecies were ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and Types and Allegories ſo conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made uſe of, they had certain Rules and Methods
<note n="†" place="margin">Joſeph. Gell. Jud. lib. iii. c. 14.</note> of Interpretation, as we learn from <hi>Joſephus,</hi> which thro length of time and the corruption of ſucceeding Ages are now loſt. And it is certain, that the <hi>Jews</hi> in the time of our Saviour and his Apoſtles were often confuſed and ſilenced by them with the Application of Types and Prophecies, which were then acknowledged to belong to the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61773:417"/>
                        <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and were ever ſo underſtood by the <hi>Jews,</hi> but would ſcarce be underſtood ſo by us, if we did not find them thus interpreted and apply'd.</p>
                     <p>We ſee then, that the obſcurity of many places of Scripture proceeds from the length of Time, and other accidents, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could not be prevented, unleſs God ſhould make a New Revelation to every Ago and Nation of the World: which yet would be of little effect to thoſe, who will not be convinced nor perſwaded by that Revelation which we have in the Scriptures. Tho the Scriptures were deſigned for the Benefit and Inſtruction of all Ages and Nations, yet they often had a more direct and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Regard to the Age and Nation, in which they were firſt penned. We have nothing left but the Names of moſt of the Hiſtorians, mentioned by St <hi>Jerom</hi> as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be read in order to explain the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and many objections made againſt the Scriptures would have no pretence, if we knew the circumſtances of affairs, and had a compleat Hiſtory of thoſe times, to which they relate; but God having given us full evidence, that the Scriptures are written by his Appointment and Direction, expects to be believed upon his word, and has not thought fit to gratify the curioſity of men, who will disbelieve it. And if men will uſe any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable care and diligence, the Senſe and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61773:418"/>of the Scriptures may be ſo far un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as is needful, in all Times, whatever difficulties there may be in ſome particular paſſages.</p>

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61773:418"/>the Comments upon moſt Hiſtories; and that thoſe who differ in other matters, muſt have the greater evidence for that in which they do agree. Tho there be ſome difficulty and variety of opinion in the calculation of the preciſe time, when ſome Prophecies were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, becauſe it is diſputed where the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is to begin, or how ſome other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance is to be underſtood; yet all Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are agreed concerning theſe very Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies that they are fulfilled. For inſtance; it is certain that the Scepter is departed from <hi>Judah,</hi> whether that Prophecy be to be underſtood of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> or the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated from that Tribe, it is certain, that the City and Sanctuary are deſtroyed, and the Sacrifice and Oblation taken away, tho Interpreters do not agree about the preciſe time and manner of the accompliſhment of every particular. Plain matter of Fact ſhews that the Prophecy is fulfilled, and there is no difficulty but about a Circumſtance; and to doubt of the fulfilling of Propheſies, becauſe we do not certainly know the exact time when every particular was fulfilled, tho we certainly know that they muſt have been all long ſince fulfilled, is as unreaſonable as if a man ſhould queſtion the Truth of Hiſtory up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of Uncertainties in Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. What man doubts whether there were ſuch a man as <hi>Homer,</hi> becauſe it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain when he lived? or whether there
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61773:419"/>ever were a <hi>Trojan</hi> War, becauſe the time of the taking of <hi>Troy</hi> has been variouſly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined? And yet is there not as much reaſon to reject this, or any other Hiſtory, which has occaſioned diſputes in point of time, as there can be to doubt of the truth of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Predictions, concerning the deſtruction of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> becauſe there may be matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy in explaining his <hi>ſeventy Weeks?</hi> The Prophecy it ſelf is plain, and the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments certain, however men may differ in aſſigning the Epocha of time. Hiſtory relates what has come to paſs, and Prophecy foretells what ſhall come, and our uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in point of Time no more affects the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility of the one than of the other. We may be uncertain of the time foretold by the Prophet, and as uncertain of the time men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the Hiſtorian, but when all other Circumſtances agree, there is no reaſon why our uncertainty as to the ſingle Circumſtance of Time ſhould be alledged againſt the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility of either of them. But the Obſcurity ariſing from the difficulties in Chronology is ſpoken of in the former Chapter.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Some Prophecies were purpoſely obſcure, becauſe they did not ſo nearly concern the Age, in which they were delivered, but were deſigned not ſo much for the information of preceeding Ages, as for the confirmation of Poſterity in the Truth of Religion, when they ſee them fulfilled. God doth not
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:61773:419"/>ſend Revelations to gratify the curioſity of men, in acquainting them with what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal their Poſterity, but rather conceals the knowledge of future events from men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the knowledge of them might have an ill effect, in making them proud, or careleſs and negligent; or elſe too ſollicitous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about what was to befall their Poſterity. The Judgments and Afflictions of Parents would be ſo much abated if they had a clear proſpect of the happineſs of their Poſterity, that they would loſe that effect, which God deſigns by ſending his Judgments. And a perfect view of the miſeries, which were to befal the Poſterity of the moſt happy Parents, would render the Bleſſings of God the leſs Bleſſings to them. So that both the Rewards and Puniſhments of this life would very much loſe their force and effect, if Prophecies were leſs obſcure than they are. It is a ſufficient Reaſon for the obſcure and myſterious delivering of ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, that they thereby ſerve to prove the Faith and Patience, and excite the Care and Watchfulneſs of men: for which reaſon, the day of Judgment, and the day of every man's Death is concealed from us, becauſe the particular and diſtinct Revelation of theſe things would cauſe ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in ſome and deſpair in others; and the caſe is the ſame as to the deſtruction of Churches and Nations: We are commanded to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61773:420"/>watch and pray, <hi>watch ye therefore, leſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſuddenly he find you ſleeping, and what I ſay unto you, I ſay unto all, watch,</hi> Mark xiii. 35. Which in the direct ſenſe of the words concerns <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but the reaſon of them will extend to the deſtruction of any other City, or to any other judgment which God has foretold, but has concealed the time or other circumſtances, either by ſilence or by uncertain and myſterious forms of Speech. A full proſpect of Proſperity to come often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times has proved fatal to men: <hi>Jeroboam, Hazael,</hi> and <hi>Jehu,</hi> were the worſe probably for the Declarations made to them; as <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thophel,</hi> if it had been foretold plainly what would befal him, would in all likelihoed ſooner have haſtened his own death. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore the event be good or bad, and whether it concern our ſelves or our Poſterity, it is fit moſt times that it ſhould not be clearly revealed to us, becauſe this would in great meaſure exclude the exerciſe of the Graces of Faith and Hope, and Patience in men, under their preſent condition. And at the time of fulfilling the Propheſies, which are now moſt obſcure, ſuch a continued Train and Series of Aftairs, with all their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Particularities, may appear in ſo full and undeniable evidence, as may convince Infidels, and confirm Believers in the truth of the Predictions, and of the Religion taught by the Prophets, by whom the events were foretold.</p>

Of this Nature are ſome of thoſe Propheſies, which relates to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's ſtate of Humiliation, his Poverty, and Crucifixion and Death, to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the rejection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which by the Circumſtances are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to us in the Accompliſhment, but were written with ſome obſcurity to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal them from the obſtinate and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Jews,</hi> that <hi>ſeeing they might ſee and not perceive:</hi> for if they had fully underſtood the ſcope and importance of them, they would have endeavoured rather to have ſuppreſſed and deſtroyed them, than they would have ſuffered them to remain to be urged againſt themſelves.

They would have ſpared Chriſt no more in the Propheſies of him than in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                     <p>Again, Obſcurity was neceſſary, becauſe ſome events could never have been brought to paſs, if they had been expreſsly and in
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61773:421"/>plain terms foretold, unleſs God would have forced men to the Accompliſhment of his Predictions, which muſt have taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Liberty of Human Actions. For men would ſcarce have ventured upon ſuch Actions, as they knew before-hand muſt end in Affliction and great Calamity, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the ruin of themſelves, or of their Families or Nation; and yet it may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that theſe things ſhould come to paſs, for the wiſe ends of Providence, and for the Good and Salvation of Mankind. Few would have ſhewn that Courage and Reſolution, which St <hi>Peter</hi> and St <hi>Paul</hi> did in preaching the Goſpel, if they had been told ſo long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as St <hi>Peter</hi> was, that it muſt end in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, or if the Holy Ghoſt had witneſſed in every City concerning them, as he did of St <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying in expreſs terms, that <hi>bonds and afflictions did abide him;</hi> moſt other men would have been <hi>moved,</hi> tho he was not, by <hi>any of theſe things,</hi> Acts xx. 23. For we find that the Diſciples upon this account were earneſt with him not to go up to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> So difficult is it for the beſt men in the beſt cauſe to reſolve to meet certain and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Dangers. The nature therefore of ſome things requires, that they ſhould not be more particularly deſcribed in the Propheſies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them. For either they muſt have been obſcurely ſpoken of, or elſe they could not have been propheſied of at all: becauſe if
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61773:421"/>they had been clearly foretold, they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have come to paſs; which implies a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction: for it is impoſſible that what God declares by his Prophets ſhould not be fulfilled. If all that was to befal the Church of Chriſt had been ſet down with the circumſtances of time and place, and perſons, by St <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> ſo as to prevent the objections of thoſe, who except againſt the obſcurity of that Book, this certainly would have proved a great diſcouragement to many Chriſtians in the performance of their Duty, and muſt have hindred the bringing to paſs the events, unleſs God ſhould have over-ruled the minds of men, and forced them upon acting, which had been to deprive them of their Freedom of Will.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If Prophecies had punctually foretold the things to be fulfilled in all their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, men would have purpoſely contrived to frame their actions in ſuch a manner, as to appear to fulfill many of them, and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they had been fulfilled, it might have been ſuppoſed to have been by deſign and contrivance. Which would have been only to act a part, or live by a rule and pattern deſcribed and ſet before them; but when the obſcurity is ſuch, that they become fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led without any Intention or Knowledge of the Perſon employed in fulfilling them, this manifeſts the wiſdom and providence of God. If Prophecies had been leſs obſcure, men would have been the more prone, to venture upon the commiſſion of ſin in order to fulfil them. We find by experience, how apt all Enthuſiaſts,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61773:422"/>and ſuch as perſwade themſelves that they have a clear and perfect knowledge of the obſcureſt Prophecies, are, to think any thing lawful to be done, which may bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoſe events, that they fancy to be the Accompliſhment of them. And if the events of all Propheſies had been concealed under no obſcurity of words and circumſtances, but had been obvious and viſible to every Reader, the number of ſuch undertakers would have been much greater: for it is a hard matter to make men diſtinguiſh between the accompliſhment of Prophecies, and the ſin which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten committed in the accompliſhment of them; but when they can ſerve their Intereſt by it, they are willing to believe the worſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons lawful, which may fulfil a Prophecy; and the clearer Propheſies had been, the more occaſion and pretence had been given to ſuch diluſions, to which none are now ſubject, but ſuch as think them clear, and perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or would perſwade others, that they throughly underſtand them.</p>

Another reaſon is, that ſometimes a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy may be delivered obſcurely, in mercy to the Inſtruments, who are to bring about the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent foretold by it.

                     <p>Again, other Propheſies may be hid in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity for a judgment upon thoſe who are obſtinate, and will not make a due uſe of the means afforded them of Salvation, but harden their hearts, and reſolve to continue impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent againſt all the methods which God has been pleaſed to uſe to reclaim them.

The <hi>Revelation</hi> of St <hi>John</hi> is hard to be applyed to particularevents, becauſe it comprehends ſo vaſt a ſeries of time, in which long courſe of years many events may be exactly alike at different times and in different places, and there may be a gradual and repeated Accompliſhment of ſome of his Prophecies.

For then every one is apt to make the caſe his own, when he ſees the Precepts reduced to Example, and cloathed with Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and brought home, as it were, to his very ſenſes, which before lay more out of ſight, in abſtract Notions and Speculative Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. And if feigned caſes be ſo much more effectual than bare precepts or exhortations, an infallible account of the ſtate of the Church in all Ages, tho we cannot point out the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular times and places, when and where every thing ſhall come to paſs, muſt needs be of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable value and benefit.</p>
                     <p>To <hi>hear what the ſpirit ſaith unto the Churches,</hi> to obſerve what errors and faults are reproved, and what vertues and graces are commended and encouraged in the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia;</hi> the Praiſes and Adorations, ch. iv. and the Bliſs of the Righteous, the joys of Heaven, and the rewards of Martyrs, ch. vii. the Terrors of the Great and Dreadful day, ch. vi. the great Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that was to be upon the Earth, ch. xiii. the Patience and Faith of the Saints, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61773:426"/>ſurrection of the Dead, ch.xx. the deſcription of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the glory and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the City of God, ch. xxi, xxii. theſe are the ſubject of St <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Revelation,</hi> and are things of the greateſt uſe and importance. We have the ſtate and condition of the Church in all Ages preſented to our view, tho we are not able to mark out the particular times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons meant in the ſeveral parts of the Prophecy. And this is at leaſt of the ſame uſe to us that all Hiſtory is, and beſides may be of as much more benefit, as it more nearly concerns us: for we do not know but that we may be faln into the worſt times there propheſy'd of. <hi>Here is the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and the faith of the Saints.</hi> We ſee the care and providence of God over his Church, the wonderful deliverances which he is pleaſed to work for it, the ſupports which he affords his faithful Servants under perſecutions, and the rewards prepared for them, and the final deſtruction of the Enemies of God and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; theſe things are viſible in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and it cannot be denied, but theſe are of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent uſe, to yield us comfort in the worſt of troubles, and to excite Faith and Hope, and Patience, and all Chriſtian Graces in the minds of men. The <hi>Revelation</hi> of St <hi>John</hi> may be look'd upon as an Hiſtory of the Church without any Chronology annext to it; but will any man ſay, that the exacteſt and trueſt Hiſtory, that can be penned, of the moſt important Affairs, and ſuch as concern all Mankind, is of little
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61773:426"/>value or conſequence to the Conduct and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of our Lives, unleſs we were likewiſe acquainted with the particular time, and the Names of the Places and Perſons deſcribed in it? It is as much as our Salvation is worth to be informed of a Future Judgment, tho' we are not told when it ſhall be; and that Book which ſets Rewards and Puniſhments, Heaven and Hell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, is of the greateſt Advantage for the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Salvation of Men, tho' the ſeveral Circumſtances and Particularities deſcribed, are unknown to us.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Tho' the Arguments from Types are above all, apt to be look'd upon as uncertain, and to depend rather upon the Conjectures and Fanſies of Men, than upon any clear Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: Yet we ſhall find the contrary, if we do but a little conſider the Nature of them. A <hi>Type</hi> is a Likeneſs, a Form, or Mould, (as the word ſignifies) and where the <hi>Antitype</hi> repreſented by it, and prefigured, Anſwers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to it, there is no more queſtion to be made, but that the one belongs to the other, than there is reaſon to doubt, when we ſee an Impreſſion made upon Wax, what kind of Seal it was by which it was made; Or, when we ſee a good Picture of one we know, to enquire who ſat for it. A Type is much of the ſame Nature in Actions or Things and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as an Allegory is in Words: but Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are oftentimes ſo plain, that no man can well miſtake what is meant by them. And thus it is as to Types in many Caſes: Indeed
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61773:427"/>where there is but one Type or one Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, it is not ſo eaſily diſcern'd; but where many concur, he muſt be very wilful that does not acknowledge the Agreement. When an Author, as it often happens, deſcribes the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of his own Time under feigned Names, a Reader who knows nothing of it, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps over-look one or two Characters, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to be by chance; but when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives that they all exactly agree to ſo many ſeveral Perſons whom he knows, he no longer doubts of the Author's Deſign. And when many Types concur in the ſame Perſon, with a great number of Particularities, any two of which perhaps never concurr'd in any one Man before; as in the Perſon of our Saviour theſe things concurr'd, that he was compell'd to carry his Croſs, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> had carried the Wood; that he was lifted up, and faſtned to it, as the Brazen Serpent had been lifted up in the Wilderneſs; that as the Bones of the Paſchal Lamb were not broken, ſo not a Bone of him was broken when the Bones of theſe were, who were Crucified with him; and that he was Crucified at the very time when the Paſchal Lamb was to be Sacrificed: when ſo many different Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances concur, which have no dependance one upon another, nor upon the Will of Him, in whom they concur, but proceed from the Will (and as in this Caſe) from the Malice of others; if theſe things meet by chance, it muſt be a very extraordinary and unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61773:427"/>Chance indeed, and much ſuch another as that was, which ſome would perſwade us made the World; it muſt be ſuch a Chance as never happened before, nor will ever happen again. But muſt not theſe Men rather ſpeak and think by chance, who can argue at this Rate?</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the Characters are ſo lively, that the Types are as evident as expreſs Words could have made them; as when in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Kingdom of Chriſt, he is ſtiled <hi>David,</hi> becauſe, as he was prefigured by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> ſo he was to deſcend from him, <hi>Jer.</hi> xxx. 9. <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxiv. 23. xxxvii. 24, 25. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> iii. 5. ſeveral Deſcriptions which were Metaphorical in reference to the Perſons immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in them, were litterally fulfilled in our Saviour: Thus the Gall and Vinegar, the Caſting of Lots upon the Garments, and the Piercing of the Hands and Feet are Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Expreſſions, of great Contempt and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty uſed towards the Perſons to whom they were at firſt applied; but in their ultimate End and Deſign, they were true to the very Letter. And where there is thus a Two-fold Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any place of Scripture, the one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and Metaphorical, the other proper and Litteral; the Perſon deſcribed in Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Terms is as clearly a Type of him, from whoſe real Condition and Circumſtances the Metaphor is taken, as a Metaphor is a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the plain Senſe contained under it.</p>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:61773:428"/>
                     <p>The Legal Diſpenſation was all Typical, and ſo the <hi>Jews</hi> ever underſtood it to be; which made the Apoſtles diſpute with them from the Types of their Law, as they ſurely would never have done, if it had not on all ſides been agreed, that it was a proper way of Argument. Their Prophecies were given out in Actions as well as in Words; and as the Mind either of God or Man may be expreſt as fully by Actions as by the plaineſt Words: ſo certainly we muſt acknowledge this to be the Caſe, when Types ſo evidently denote the Perſon, and ſo properly belong to him, as to declare and beſpeak him to be the Man, in ſuch a manner that we ſhould conclude, that any Perſon of our own Times muſt needs be meant by any Author, who ſhould thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe him in a Book, the Deſign whereof was known to be, to make ſuch Deſcriptions. It is not indeed every Reſemblance which we may conclude from, but where many Types concur in the ſame Perſon, where the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence depends wholly upon the Will of his Adverſaries, or not in the leaſt upon his own Will; when theſe Types were alledged from a Diſpenſation, which was all along held to be Typical; in this caſe they may be urged, and as ſafely relyed upon as any other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. In the laſt place, I am to ſhew that the obſcurity of the Scriptures is not ſuch as
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61773:428"/>to be any prejudice to their Authority, nor to the End and Deſign of them. And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this is implied by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he ſays, that there are but <hi>ſome things hard to be underſtood</hi> in the Scriptures, and the reſt are plain and obvious. All things neceſſary to Salvation are ſufficiently clear in the Scripture; and tho' there be other things in them which are obſcure, yet we ſee that Reaſons may be given (and perhaps many more and better than I am able to produce) why they are and ought to be ſo. God ſupplies us in Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries with a bountiful and open Hand; and what is not neceſſary, he ſurely may diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more ſparingly and more obſcurely to us. It is ſo in the things of this Life: Our Senſes ſeldom or never fail us in things neceſſary to our Life and Health, tho' in other things we find our ſelves miſled by them; every Country and Place affords the Neceſſaries of Life; and that which is moſt rare is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways leaſt neceſſary; it may be uſeful, but yet we may very well be without it. Now to complain that all places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture are not intelligible by all, is, as if we ſhould blame Providence for not making all Men Rich, and all Countries like the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> it is a ſign we are reſolved to find fault, and never to be ſatisfied with what we have unleſs we be humoured in every thing. But we ſhould do well firſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how we can expect this at God's Hands,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61773:429"/>or how well we have deſerved it of Him. <hi>The Secret of the Lord is with them that Fear him, and he will ſhew them his Covenant.</hi> Pſal. xxv. 14. <hi>For the froward is an Abomination to the Lord, but his Secret is with the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Prov.</hi> iii. 32. There are Secrets and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries in Religion which cannot be ſuppoſed to be known to any but thoſe, who are thro'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with the plainer Doctrines, both in the Study and the Practice of them; and therefore if no ſuch Reaſons as have been now offered, could be given for the obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Scriptures in ſome places, it would be unreaſonable, however, for ſuch Men as make this an Objection to urge it; they have no Right to object whatever others may have; becauſe they have never uſed the Means to know whether the Scriptures are ſo obſcure as they pretend or or not. But they will never be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to prove, that if things neceſſary both in Faith and Practice be clearly ſet down, there may not be other things deliverd which are <hi>hard</hi> to <hi>be underſtood,</hi> and which thoſe may <hi>wreſt to their own Deſtruction,</hi> who are <hi>unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>unstable;</hi> that is, who have neither Learning and Skill enough to judge of ſuch Matters, nor yet Conſtancy and Stedfaſtneſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the Faith, to adhere to what they do underſtand, and not to perplex them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſuffer themſelves to be perverted by judging raſhly of things above their Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:61773:429"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The unlearned and unstable only are ſaid to wreſt the Scriptures to their own Deſtruction:</hi> And tho' it is not in the Power and Capacity of every Man to be Wiſe and Learned, yet it is in every ones Power not to be unſtable, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and ſtedfaſt to what he underſtands, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to depart from it for any By-ends or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. Let us learn what is eaſy to be known, and Practice what we know, before we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that the Scriptures are obſcure. Let us ſtudy and practiſe the Scriptures more, and this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction will not appear ſo formidable. But the Truth is, thoſe that moſt uſe it, neither ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy nor practiſe them. And yet after all their Pretences of Obſcurity, they have a greater quarrel againſt the plain parts of Scripture, than againſt the obſcure ones; they know many places of Scripture which are plainly againſt them, and this makes them ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt all the reſt.</p>
                     <p>What has been here ſaid in general, I hope may be in ſome Meaſure uſeful to thoſe who deſire to read the Scriptures for their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Edification; and in particular Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties Books muſt be conſulted, or ſuch Men as may be ſuppoſed to underſtand them.

                     <p>Thus our Saviour, when notwithſtanding all his Mighty works, many would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Him, but queſtioned His Authority, and reviled His Perſon, and blaſphemed the Holy Spirit, by which they were wrought, was not concerned to work more Miracles, merely for the Satisfaction, or rather at the captious Demands of theſe Men, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him to do it.

And if, becauſe of ſome places that are difficult in the Scriptures, Men will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the whole, rather than be at the pains to ſearch out the true Meaning of theſe places, or than be ſo modeſt and humble, as to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that there may be ways of Reconciling thoſe, which appear to them, contradictions, tho' they have not yet found them out, they muſt fall under the ſame Condemnation with thoſe, who will deny the Being of God, if they cannot ſatisfy themſelves how he made and governs the world; or with thoſe that would believe none of our Saviour's Miracles, unleſs he would work them when, and where, and juſt in what manner they pleaſed. But the wiſdom of God ſees that nothing would ſatisfy theſe Men, and that they only tempt God, and deſign no real Satisfaction to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: and therefore he cannot be obliged to new model the World, and alter the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures for their ſakes, ſince there is enough in them for the Satisfaction of all that are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in their Enquiries after Truth.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The only way to judge rightly of the particular places of any Book, is to conſider firſt the whole Deſign, and Contrivance, and Method, and Stile of it, not to criticize upon ſome difficult Parts of it, without any regard had to the reſt. This is the Method uſed by all, who would criticize with Judgment upon any Author. And ſome Paſſages of Scripture are explained to our hands, to be a Key, as it
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61773:431"/>were, and a Direction to us in the Explication of others. Thus, whereas in one place it is ſaid, that Jeſus baptized, in another it is ſaid, that he baptized not, and the former place is expalined to be meant not of Baptiſm perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Himſelf, but by his Diſciples, who baptized in his Name. <hi>Joh.</hi> iii. 22. iv. 1, 2.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. It is reaſonable to obſerve whether the Objections be not ſuch as do ſuppoſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, which a Man, who could write ſuch a Diſcourſe, as they are imagined to be found in, could not run into. For if they be of this Nature, this very Conſideration is enough to take off the force of the Objection againſt the Authority of any Book; and we muſt conclude that the Objections are capable of being anſwered, and that the Miſtake lies not in the Book it ſelf, but in the Readers, who without ſufficient Skill or Attention, paſs a raſh Judgment upon it. For by all the Rules of Reaſoning, an Objection may imply too much, as well as prove too little to be of any force: And the common Rules of Candor and Equity would prevent many Objections which are wont to be made againſt the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. For if we will but ſuppoſe the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Scriptures to have been Men of any tolerable Senſe, even without Inſpiration, they could never have committed ſuch miſtakes as ſome would faſten upon them.

I appeal to any Man, whether, if he had met with two ſuch Paſſages, which ſeem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict each other, in <hi>Thucidides</hi> or <hi>Xenophon,</hi> or, even in the very worſt Hiſtorian, he would not be enclined rather to ſeek out for ſome
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61773:432"/>way of reconciling them, than to ſuſpect that he could ſo ſoon forget what he had written ſo little a while before, in an Account of a Thing of that Nature. Of the ſame kind is that Difference, which is between the Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of Chriſt in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and that in St. <hi>Luke.</hi> For there is no doubt but the Genealogies of the <hi>Jews</hi> were then, and long after, extant in the Publick Regiſters,

The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of their Cauſe wholly depended upon the Proof of Chriſt's Deſcent from <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> and therefore whatever Difficulties there may now be thought to be in this Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Genealogy; it was certainly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by thoſe of that Age, and beyond all Diſpute, or elſe it would never have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Evangeliſts, or had for ever ruined their Cauſe, if they had produced it.</p>
                     <p>Some Crimes are too great to charge upon Men of any Credit or Reputation; and ſome Errors are ſo notorious that no Man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prudence can be ſuppoſed to commit them: And therefore when we find an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

                     <p n="4">IV. If any Contradictions be framed or forced from the various Readings, the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Chronology, or whatever elſé of this Nature is to be found in the Diſputes of Criticks; they prove no more againſt the Authority of the Scriptures, than they do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Authority of all other Books in the World, unleſs it could be ſhewn that theſe Difficulties could not happen in a Book written by Divine Inſpiration, but that it muſt be firſt written in ſuch a manner as to afford no occaſion for Diſputes, and that it muſt be ever after ſo preſerved by a conſtant Miracle, that it may be ſubject to none of the Accidents and Caſualties, to which all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Books are liable. On the contrary it can never be proved that God might not permit Books written by Inſpiration, to be obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to any ſuch Caſualties as are not prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the End and Deſign of a Revelation. But if the <hi>neceſſary</hi> points of <hi>Doctrine</hi> be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved entire, and the <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>Matters
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61773:433"/>of Fact</hi> be ſufficient to prove the Truth of the <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Prophecies</hi> in Confirmation of that Doctrine; all leſſer Matters may be leſt to the ſame contingencies which befall all other Books in the World.</p>
                     <p>That the Evidence is very clear and full in Proof both of the <hi>Prophecies</hi> and <hi>Miracles,</hi> which demonſtrate to us the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Scriptures, has been already ſhewn, and if no more could be produced than has by me been brought to prove their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet unleſs this can be proved to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient from ſome miſtakes or defects in it, no ſuch Objections can invalidate it. Becauſe no Man can prove that God might not ſuffer a Book written by his own Appointment and Authority, to be encumbred thro' length of Time, and the frailty and negligence of Men, with inſuperable Difficulties, if it be ſuppoſed ſtill to retain the viſible Marks and Characters of a Divine Original in all the <hi>Evidence</hi> neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to prove it from <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> and in the <hi>Doctrines</hi> delivered by it. For as long as theſe two things are ſecured, all the reſt tho' it be of never ſo great Uſe and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, yet cannot be neceſſary in order to the ends of a Divine Revelation. And therefore a Book of Divine Revelation might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by God for the Sins, and by the Fault and Ignorance of Men, to become perplext with abundance of divers Readings, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with Contradictions in the Chronologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

For ſo long as it cannot be proved Defective as to the ends and purpoſes of a Divine Revelation, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for want of evidence to make it appear to be ſuch, or thro' defect of the Matter and Doctrine contained in it; all other Difficulties will never prove it not to be of Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, becauſe ſo long as there is no Defect, but what might be in any Book, tho' we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to be of Divine Authority.</p>

But there has an Opinion of late years prevailed, very injurious to Religion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to Reaſon and the Judgment of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages; That God only created Matter and gave it Motion, to be performed under certain Laws, by which all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature both in the Creation and Preſervation of Things are brought about, without any
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61773:434"/>farther immediate Divine Power or Concourſe, than what is juſt neceſſary to continue this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Motion in Being; that is, God created Matter, and put it into Motion, and then Matter and Motion do all the reſt in a ſettled Courſe, and by eſtabliſhed Laws, without any need of the Divine Aid or Direction. This Notion indeed can never be reconciled to the Scriptures, but then it is as little befriended by Reaſon and Natural Religion. In proof of which, I ſhall conſider: I. The Creation of the World, II. The Preſervation of it; and ſhall ſhew, that neither of them could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in this way.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. As to the Creation, we may conſider both the <hi>Time</hi> and the <hi>Manner</hi> of it. And by the Time of the Creation, we may underſtand either the Time, when the Creation of the World began, or the Time which was taken up in the Creation of it. But this latter ſenſe will come under what is to be ſaid of the Manner of the Creation.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Time of the Creation of the World, as that ſignifies the Beginning of Time, or of the Worlds Duration, muſt be wholly Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, and abſolutely at God's Sovereign Pleaſure and Diſpoſal. For there could be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in eternal Duration to fix the Creation of the World more to one Time than another, or to determin why it ſhould begin ſooner or later. And ſince it is impoſſible that the world ſhould be eternal, it is evident, that the Time of the

                        <pb n="194" facs="tcp:61773:436"/>Creation, whenever it was, can be no good Objection, becauſe, tho' the World had been created never ſo long before, there muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily have been as much a Pretence for ſuch an Objection. For there muſt have been ſome Period of Time, when the World had exiſted no longer than it has done now: and no beginning of the World can be ſuppoſed ſo long ago, but ſtill it might with the ſame Reaſon be ask'd, why it was not created ſooner?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In conſidering the <hi>Manner</hi> of the Worlds Creation, I ſhall prove, (1.) That there is no Reaſon to ſuppoſe the World to have been at the firſt made by Mechanical Laws, tho' it were preſerv'd according to ſuch Laws. (2.) That there are ſufficient Reaſons to be given for its Creation in that Manner, which we find related in the Book of <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) There is no Reaſon to ſuppoſe the World to have been at firſt made by Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichal Laws, tho' it were preſerved according to ſuch Laws (whereas I ſhall afterwards prove, that it is not preſerved according to them.) There is no Reaſon that the World ſhould be firſt framed according to the Laws of Motion which are eſtabliſhed for its Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Government in its fixt and ſettled State. The Origin of the Univerſe was by the immediate hand of God, before the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſeveral Laws which afterwards were to take place; and we may as well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:61773:436"/>to reduce the working of Miracles to the ſtanding Laws of Nature as the Creation of the World. For certainly of all Miracles the Creation of the World muſt be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, not only as it ſignifies the Production of Matter and Motion out of Nothing, but as it was the putting things into ſuch Order, as to make them capable of the Laws of Motion ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them. It is not yet agreed, nor is it ever like to be, what theſe Laws of Motion are, which the Philoſophers ſo much talk of, and there being ſuch a mutual Connexion and Combination of Bodies, and ſuch a Dependance of every Body upon ſo many others in every Motion, it is impoſſible to know how any two Bodies would act upon each other, if they were ſeparate from all Bodies beſides, or were out of that State which they now are in. It is reaſonable therefore to imagine, that the ſeveral Parts of the World muſt be ranged and ſettled before theſe Laws could take place; and to reduce the Creation of the World to the Laws of Motion which now prevail in it, is to ſuppoſe a Creation antecedent to that by which the World was made. This is as if an <hi>Indian</hi> ſhould attempt to give an Account of the making of a Watch by the ſeveral Motions, which he ſees performed in it after it is made, and ſhould imagine that the Materials moving in ſuch a manner, at laſt arrived to the exact frame of a Watch.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) There are ſufficient Reaſons to be
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:61773:437"/>given for the Creation of the World in that manner, which we find related in the Book of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> It is great Preſumption in Men to be too curious and inquiſitive about the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of God's Actions: for whatever he delivers of himſelf, we ought entirely to believe both the Thing it ſelf and the manner and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of it. <hi>Where wast thou when I laid the Foundations of the Earth, declare, if thou hast <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding. Job.</hi> xxxviii. 4. But this muſt be ſaid to the Glory of God, and to the Shame of all ſuch as Cenſure and Cavil at his Word, that even by Men ſuch Reaſons may be given of his Actions, as all his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries ſhall not be able to gain-ſay.</p>
                     <p>God hath <hi>ordered all things in Meaſure, and Number, and Weight,</hi> Wiſd. xi. 20. And as to thoſe who enquire, why the World was created in ſix days rather than in one day, or in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, or in a long compaſs of Years, as the Laws of Matter and Motion, they ſay, require: It might be ſufficient to ask, why, if it was God's Will, the World might not be created in ſix Days, as well as in any other number of Days or ſpace of Time? If the Creation had been in an Inſtant, or in a longer or ſhorter ſpace of Time, the Queſtion might with as much Reaſon have been put, why it was not created in ſix days? Shall Men preſume to preſcribe to God the Time and Manner of his Actions? Is not his own Pleaſure a ſufficient Reaſon of them? The Manner of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61773:437"/>and of the Flood, which have of late been the Subject of ſo many Diſputes, depends ſolely upon the Will and Pleaſure of God, and therefore we can know only by Revelation, how they were effected, and it is in vain to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that they muſt have come to paſs in this or that Manner, unleſs it could be prov'd, that God could not bring them to paſs any other way than that, which the Inventor of ſome <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> thinks fit to propoſe. Moſt Actions may be performed very different ways; and if, for inſtance, we had only a general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Paſſage of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> into the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> purſuing them, was drowned with his whole Army, that they travell'd in the Wilderneſs forty Years, and had a ſufficient Proviſion of Food, and Cloathing, and Water for ſo great a Multitude, in ſo barren a place, and for ſo long a time: tho' never ſo many Conjectures ſhould be made, how all this might be, and never ſo many Schemes were drawn of their Journeyings and Encampments; if it could be ſuppoſed poſſible, that one of all theſe might prove true, yet it would be utterly impoſſible to know which were it. But when we are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told, that God created the World in ſix days, and that ſuch and ſuch things were created on each of theſe Days, that he brought a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of VVaters upon the whole Earth for the Sins of Mankind; which continued for ſuch a time upon the face of the Earth; ſome Men
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:61773:438"/>will needs aſſign the particular Means and Manner, by which both the Creation and the Flood muſt neceſſarily have been brought to paſs, as if the wiſdom and power of God, and the nature of things could admit of no other way, but what they can explain. VVe may eſteem the Learning, and admire the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity, and allow the good Intentions of theſe Authors; but when any one advanceth an <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis</hi> in contradiction to all others, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it, not as probable, but as the only true Explication of Scripture, and poſitively main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, not only that things might be ſo, if God pleaſed, but that they were ſo, and could not be otherwiſe; this to me ſeems more unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, than any thing I ever met with beſides, in the very worſt <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> We can know nothing of the way and manner how God has been pleaſed to do any thing but by his own Revelation. If each <hi>Frypotheſis</hi> were poſſible, yet no man could be certain which were the right, or that any of them were ſo; becauſe God might make uſe of ſome other Means than what Men can imagine. But when the ſeveral <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> deſtroy one another, and every one pretends to ſet up his own in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to all the reſt, and none can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its Ground any longer than till another has been brought to confute it, it were ſtrange, if Men ſhould ſatisfy themſelves with ſuch Uncertainties, rather than with the plain word of God.</p>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:61773:438"/>
                     <p>According to any Mechanical <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> (tho' there were no <hi>Vacuum</hi>) ſo many Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents muſt continually intervene in a Chaos of Matter confuſedly rolling and knocking one part of it againſt another, that it ſeems next to an Impoſſibility, that it ſhould ever ſettle into any Order: at leaſt, if Matter had been left to its own workings and jumblings accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any Mechanical Laws of Motion, the world for ought any Man can prove, might not have been made to this Moment. So far is it from being poſſible to underſtand, how, upon Mechanical Principles, the world ſhould have been made in ſix Years, rather than in ſix Days, conſiſting of four and twenty Hours. It is therefore the boldeſt Attempt that can be conceived for Men to pretend to aſſign the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſteps and degrees in the proceſs of this wonderful Operation, with as much eaſe and certainty, as if they had all the Materials by them in their Laboratory, and could perform it as readily as an ordinary courſe of Chymiſtry.

                     <p>The Angels were the beginning of the Creation, and were created probably in the Morning of the firſt Day. For in the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> God ſays, that when the Foundations of the Earth were laid, <hi>the Morning Stars ſang together, and all the Sons of God ſhouted for Joy.</hi> Job xxxviii. 7. from whence we learn that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were created before this viſible World, and glorified God for his creating it. Now the Angels, tho' bleſſed and glorious Spirits, yet are finite, and are unable to comprehend and fathom the wonderful works of God; there are things which <hi>the Angels deſire to look into,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.12. and the more they know of God and his Works, the more they adore and praiſe Him. The whole Scene of the Creation ſeems to have been laid open in Order before them, according to the ſeveral Degrees and the various Natures of things, whereby they muſt have had a fuller View and a
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:61773:439"/>clearer Underſtanding of the Divine Power and Wiſdom, than they could have had, if the World had ſtarted forth in an Inſtant, and jump'd, as it were, into this beautiful Frame and Order. As he who ſees the whole Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and Contrivance of any Curious piece of Art, values and admires the Artiſt more than one does, that beholds it in Groſs. God was pleaſed therefore to diſplay his Glory before the Angels, and by ſeveral ſteps and degrees, to excite their Praiſe, and Love, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration, which moved them to <hi>Songs</hi> and <hi>Shouts of Joy,</hi> and by this means his Glory and their own Happineſs was advanced, much beyond what it would have been, if all things had been created and diſpoſed into their Rank and Order at one Moment. They look'd into the firſt Principles and Seeds of Things, and every day preſented them with a glorious Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle of New Wonders; the firſt Seven Days of the World, they kept a continual Triumph or Jubile; and thus their Voices were tuned and raiſed, as I may ſay, to thoſe Praiſes, which were to be their Employment and their Happineſs to all Eternity; the more they ſaw, the more they knew, and the more they knew of the Works of God, the more they for ever loved and adored Him.</p>

                     <p n="2">(2.) By this ſucceſſive and Gradual Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Diſpoſition of things in ſix days at the Creation; the Glory of God is likewiſe more manifeſted to Men than it would have been, if all had been done at once, or by
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:61773:442"/>ſlow and tedious Methods. This gives us a more clear and diſtinct comprehenſive Notion of the Works of God than we could other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have had. It is acknowledged, that <hi>Moſes</hi> has given ſuch an Account of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, as is more intelligible and better ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to the Capacities of the generality of Men, than that which any one would now obtrude upon us as a true Account of it: But whatever Reaſons can be aſſigned why the Creation ſhould be deſcribed as it is in the Book of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> the ſame Reaſons will prove that it was fitting it ſhould be ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: If it be more ſuitable to the Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Apprehenſions of Men, that the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the World ſhould be delivered to us as finiſhed in ſix days rather than in a leſs or a longer time; it was fit that it ſhould have been really finiſhed in this ſpace of time, and ſhould be indeed ſo performed as might make the Hiſtory the more uſeful to us. For in reſpect of God it was alike to Create all things in an inſtant, or to do it ſucceſſively in a ſhorter or a longer time; and in reſpect of Mankind no reaſon can be aſſigned why the Hiſtory of the Creation ſhould be delivered ſo as to repreſent it to Men as performed in this manner; but the ſame Reaſon will hold why it ſhould have been in the ſame manner performed.</p>

                        <hi>God Bleſſed the Seventh day and Sanctified it, becauſe that in it he had reſted from all his

God ſaw it fitting that a day ſhould be ſet apart to Commemorate the Creation, and to Praiſe him for all his wonderful Works, and that this day ſhould return at ſuch a diſtance of time; and he obſerved ſuch Order in the Creation, that every day between theſe Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods of time might bring ſome particular work of it to Remembrance, and every Seventh day might conclude in the Commemoration of the whole Creation.</p>
                     <p>Our Saviour anſwers the Phariſees, when they propoſed the Queſtion to him about Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorces, by putting them in Mind of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which God uſed in the Creation, <hi>Have ye not read that he which made them at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning made them Male and Female? And ſaid, for this cauſe ſhall a Man leave Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſhall cleave to his Wife: and they
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61773:443"/>twain ſhall be one Fleſh?</hi> Matth. xix. 4, 5. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> in like manner, to ſhew that the Woman ought not to uſurp Authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Man, proves it by this Argument: <hi>For Adam was firſt formed, then Eve.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 13. and in another place and upon another occaſion he obſerves, that <hi>the Man is not of the Woman, but the Woman of the Man.</hi> 1 Cor. xi. 8. And long before the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> had Argued from the ſame Topick, <hi>Malach.</hi> ii. 15. And <hi>Hebr.</hi> iv. 4. it is noted, that <hi>God did reſt the Seventh day from all his Works,</hi> from whence the Apoſtle concludes, that <hi>he that is entred into his reſt, he alſo hath ceaſed from his own Works, as God did from his, Verſ.</hi> 10. Now as theſe and whatever other Arguments are to be found in the Scriptures of the like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, do evidently ſuppoſe the Creation of the World in the ſame manner, as it is related in the Book of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> ſo they explain to us the Reaſons why it was thus Created. For all theſe Arguments had been loſt, and there could have been no ground for them, if the World had been otherwiſe created. As cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly therefore, as this Arguing from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Creation is good: So certain it is, both that the World was ſo Created, and that there was great Reaſon for it.</p>
                     <p>But whatever ſome Philiſophers may think now, there is nothing which would have been more diſagreeable to the Notions of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the wiſeſt Men in all Ages, than
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61773:443"/>that the World ſhould be made upon Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Principles. <hi>He ſpake, and it was done, he commanded, and it ſtood fact,</hi> Pſal. xxxiii. 9. <hi>He Commanded and they were Created.</hi> Pſal. Cxlviii. 5. This expreſſes not only the Truth of the Hiſtory but the general ſenſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, who have ever had this Notion of God, that to command and to do is the ſame thing with him. And therefore the Objection till of late has run the other way, that God did rather Create the World, in an inſtant than in ſix days. It was little ſuſpected formerly that divers Years or many Ages were ſpent in the Creation. It was in the Deſcription of the Creation of the World that <hi>Longinus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the ſublime Style of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and if the Relation of it be admirable, the Creation it ſelf in ſuch a manner as is there related, muſt be much more admirable. For it is proper for it to be thus deſcribed, for no other Reaſon, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was proper for it in this manner to be done. But what would <hi>Longinus</hi> have ſaid, if the Creation had been related to have been perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not by any command which had its immediate effect, but by the tedious Proceſs of Mechanical Cauſes? What Grandeur, what evidence of the Divine Power and Majeſty is there in this more than in any Chymical Operation, if the Mechanical <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> were true?</p>
                     <p>It were ſtrange Preſumption to demand of Almighty God a Reaſon of all his Actions, and not to believe him upon his Word, that he has done any thing, but when and how
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61773:444"/>ſome Men conceit it ought to have been done. But what I have now ſaid may at leaſt ſerve to ſilence the Cavils of ſuch Men.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Preſervation of the World is not performed according to Mechanical Laws or Principles. The Mechanical <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that Bodies act upon Bodies, or Actives upon Paſſives in a certain courſe, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch Laws as that, being left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they neceſſarily produce their Effects without any immediate Interpoſition of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power. But this Notion is grounded wholly upon miſtakes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It ſuppoſes that there was at firſt a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain quantity of Motion infuſed or impreſſed upon Matter which ſtill continues paſſing from one Body to another according to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Methods or Rules preſcribed. But this Suppoſition that there is always the ſame Quantity of Motion in the World is wholly precarious, or rather notoriouſly falſe, and the beſt Philoſophers have been able to give no Account how Motion can be Communicated without an immediate Impulſe or Concourſe of the Divine Power.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By the Mechanical <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as a thing certain, that there is a <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> which at leaſt is very uncertain, or rather it has been demonſtrated by Mr. <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> that there is a <hi>Vacuum</hi> not only interſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but of a Prodigious and almoſt incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble extent at the diſtance of the Earths Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameter
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61773:444"/>from us. And by his Principles, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation muſt proceed from an immediate and conſtant Impreſſion or Impulſe of God. For it proceeds from no Action of one Body up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, but is a Quality belonging to all Matter alike, and to every particle of Matter, however ſeparate and diſtant from all others. The <hi>Projectile</hi> Motion, and that <hi>Attractive</hi> Force, by which the Planets are carried in their Orbits cannot be communicated or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed according to any Mechanical Laws, whereby they are determined from a <hi>Rectilinear</hi> to an <hi>Orbicular</hi> Motion. For Bodies can act upon Bodies only by Contract, and therefore cannot Communicate their Motion, or any way determin, or affect the Motion of each other in a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> ſo vaſt as it muſt be near the Circumference of the ſeveral Orbits, ſo that the old <hi>occult Qualities</hi> and <hi>Subſtantial Terms</hi> were not more repugnant to the Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> than theſe Principles are. The being of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> muſt ſuppoſe an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Divine Power neceſſary to keep the Syſtem of the World in that order in which we ſee it continue. For otherwiſe by this Principle of Gravitations, being inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in every Part of Matter, all Bodies would preſs towards the Center, and in a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum</hi> there can be nothing to hinder their tendency towards it, till they come crowding the upon another; ſo that all the Order of things would ſoon be reduced to one confuſed
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61773:445"/>Heap or Moſs, unleſs ſome immaterial Power interpoſed to hinder it.</p>
                     <p>It is evident then that the Mechanical <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis</hi> is quite deſtroyed by theſe Principles. For by theſe here is no Connexion of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Effects according to any Laws of mere Matter and Motion; but all muſt be done by the immediate Power of God, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation and the Projectile Motion muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and ſuſpended without any dependance upon ſurrounding Bodies; they muſt produce their Effects thro' prodigious void Spaces, where Bodies have no Communication of Motion from one to another. And all being performed by the immediate directing and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Hand of God, a Man may as well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſolve a Miracle Mechanically, as to give any Account of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by Mechanical Laws according to theſe Principles.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Abetters of the Mechanical Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis argue, that God acts in the moſt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Uniform ways, that it is more becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Wiſdom to let Nature have its courſe, and that conſtantly to interpoſe, would be a diſparagement to the Order and Contrivance in his Eſtabliſhment of the Laws of Motion; that Matter and Motion are with that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſet to work, that they can perform all without any more than preſerving and ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in their Being and Operations; and that he is the beſt Artiſt, who can contrive
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61773:445"/>an Engine that ſhall need the leaſt medling with, after it is made. But it ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, what the Nature of the Engine is, and what the ends and uſes of it are, and if the Nature of it be ſuch, that it cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the ends for which it was framed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſometimes an aſſiſting Hand, it would be no point of Wiſdom in the Artificer, for the Credit of his Contrivance, to loſe the moſt uſeful Ends deſign'd by it. As if among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſes this curious Engine were deſign'd to reward the Good and puniſh bad Men; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the puniſhment upon Amendment, and to renew it upon a Relapſe: Since Brute Matter is uncapable of varying its Motion, and ſuiting it ſelf to the ſeveral States and Changes of Free Agents; he muſt aſſiſt it unleſs he will loſe the Chief end for which it is to ſerve. It is no defect in the Skill and Wiſdom of the Almighty, that Matter and Motion have not Free will as Men have: But it would be a great defect in his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, not to make them the Inſtruments of Rewards and Puniſhment, becauſe it is impoſſible for them of themſelves to apply and ſuit themſelves to the ſeveral States and Conditions of Free Agents.</p>
                     <p>The Nature of Matter and Motion is ſuch, that they cannot ſerve all the Deſigns of their Creator without his Interpoſition, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he conſtantly doth interpoſe according to a certain Tenour which he has preſcribed to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61773:446"/>himſelf; but this Tenour and Courſe is alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſome important Occaſions. In a natural and ordinary way he Cures Diſeaſes, ſends Rain or dry Weather, or elſe our Prayers to him would be inſignificant upon ſuch Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and there would be no room left for his inflicting theſe Temporal Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. He feeds the Hungry that cry to him, and he puniſhes the Wicked when he ſees it fitting, by Famine, or Drought, or Peſtilence, in the ordinary Methods of his Providence. But ſometimes he alters theſe ordinary Methods, and acts above them or contrary to them, to ſignalize his Mercy or his Judgments: And thus Chriſt fed ſo many thouſands in the Wilderneſs, and God Rained down Fire from Heaven upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah</hi> by a particular and miraculous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation. Miracles are the particular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God in peculiar Caſes and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and the courſe of Nature is his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and perpetual Appointment at all other times. God at no time leaves Nature to it ſelf, but ever concurs with it, by aſſiſting its Power and directing its courſe, he ordinarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſes in the conſtant courſe of Things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to eſtabliſhed Laws: But Miracles are his wonderful Work, when he interpoſes in an extraordinary manner, and alters that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod which he has preſcribed to himſelf to obſerve in the common courſe of Nature. God doth not in an extraordinary manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61773:446"/>to prevent the irregular or unuſual productions of Nature as in moſtrous Births, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For how irregular ſoever theſe may ſeem, yet they are according to this ſtanding Rule, that they ſhall be ſuffered to happen in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Caſes; and they rarely happening, ſerve to illuſtrate the Divine Wiſdom in contriving Nature, ſo that in its general Courſe all its Operations ſhould be regular and uniform; and from hence it appears that God doth not extraordinarily interpoſe to alter the Courſe of Nature, but for great Ends, Superiour to thoſe which concern only the material World.</p>
                     <p>We may well ſuppoſe that God has at much regard to his Wiſdom in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Moral, as of the Material Part of the Creation; and yet he has added ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws to enforce the Moral Laws, and theſe additional Laws have been changed, as the Circumſtances and Condition of Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. Why then ſhould the Laws of the Material World be ſo much more ſacred, as that he ſhould never intermeddle with them? He aſſiſts Moral Agents with the continual ſupplies of his Grace, and natural Agents with that help which is needful for them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his will. God may haſten and aſſiſt natural cauſes upon our Prayers, he may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the Motions and enforce the Powers of Nature, and remove ſecret Impediments, to help and make way for natural Operations, or he may ſlacken or retard natural Cauſes.</p>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:61773:447"/>
                     <p>To ſay that God has ſo ordered the courſe of Nature as upon the fore-ſight of Mens Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to him, to grant them what they Pray for, and upon the fore-ſight that they will not Pray, to withhold from them what they want by Mechanical Laws, is by no means ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. For there is neither Proof nor poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Proof of it, it is merely a Suppoſition without any ground of Reaſon, but only this, that the Mechanical Notion cannot otherwiſe be maintained. But I will ſuppoſe with much more Reaſon, that two Men are Sick of the ſame Diſeaſe, that the Circumſtances of the Diſeaſe are all the ſame, and, all outward Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents likewiſe the ſame, till the Prayers of one of them make a Difference. For one of theſe Men upon his Prayers Recovers, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neglecting to Pray, Dies. The natural Cauſes are ſuppoſed to be the ſame, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only ſo far as Prayer moves God. in his Mercy to make a Difference in their Caſe. To ſay that this never happened, is wholly precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and hard to believe, ſince it probably may often happen in Epidemical Diſtempers; but it is much harder to believe that it can never happen; and if this either have or can happen, it is not upon fore-ſight of their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, by the contrivance of Mechanical Laws in their firſt Eſtabliſhment, but by an immediate Act, that God aſſiſts Men upon their Prayers to him. The ſtrange Providential Deliverances of ſome certain Perſons are obſervable in every
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61773:447"/>Age, and all Hiſtories mention them. But how ſhall particular Men, amidſt the greateſt Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, be preſerved in the common Calamities of the Sword, and Famine, and Peſtilence, but by a particular interpoſing Providence? Were theſe Men who have been ſo remarkably preſerv'd all of one Conſtitution; or do Soldiers Slay Mechanically, tho' the Plague and Famine ſhould be ſuppoſed to do ſo? I wonder it ſhould be thought leſs agreeable to Philoſophy, for God to interpoſe in directing natural Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes than in over-ruling Moral Agents, where the Deſigns of the Providence equally require it. The ſame Providence delivers both <hi>from the ſnare of the Hunter and from the noiſome Peſtilence. A thouſand ſhall fall beſides thee, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand at thy Right Hand, but it ſhall not come nigh thee, Pſal.</hi> xci. 3.7.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Mechanical Philoſophy proceeds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a wrong Notion of God, ſuppoſing it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of him to be concerned immediately. in every thing which is done. We may as well imagine it below him to know every thing, as to ſuppoſe it unworthy of him to concern himſelf in it: And yet he cannot but know every thing being Omniſcient, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but concur in every Operation of natural Cauſes, being Omnipreſent, and wherever he is, he Acts. It is the Perfection of the Eye to ſee all that is within View, how ſmall and inconſiderable ſoever it be; nay, the ſmaller the Object diſcerned is, the more perfect it
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61773:448"/>proves the ſight to be: And if a Man could do every little thing at the ſame time that he does things of Importance, and with no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to himſelf, it would be ſurely more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in him than to do theſe only. But a Variety of buſineſs is troubleſome to Men, and ſmall Affairs hinder and call them off from thoſe of moment. Tho' with God it is quite otherwiſe; he acts with the ſame Eaſe wherewith he ſees or knows or exiſts; he knows all things with one Omniſcient Thought, and he does all things by one omnipotent Act, nothing can be in the leaſt difficult to him, and nothing can be done without him, <hi>In Him we live and move and have our Being. Act.</hi> xvii. 28. And what the Scripture delivers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Creation and Preſervation of the World, may in ſtrictneſs of Philoſophy be taken in a proper and litteral Senſe. But do Men indeed conſider what it is to make and preſerve a World, when they pretend to ſhew by what ſteps God proceeds in it, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the whole Proceſs, as it were, of the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? Is there not infinite Wiſdom requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to know what infinite Power only can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?</p>
                     <p>And after all, it is very probable both from Scripture and from Reaſon, that the inviſible and immaterial part of the Creation has a greater Share in the guidance and conduct of the viſible and material part of it, than is commonly ſuppoſed.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:61773:448"/>improvement of experimental Philoſophy, and the various <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> which have been raiſed upon it; Men have been apt to look upon natural Philoſophy not only as a diſtinct Science, but as wholly ſeparate from the reſt, as if there were no ſubordination and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance between the viſible and inviſible World; whereas it is reaſonable to believe that there is a continued Connexion and Chain of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the Operations and Productions of things, and a conſtant influence and intercourſe between the Superior and Inferior Created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. It is certain that God uſeth the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of Angels in the Government of the World, but how far, and to what particular purpoſes, and upon what occaſions, no Man is able to determine: However, thoſe who have been the moſt curious inquirers into Nature, daily meet with ſo many new and ſtrange Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcoveries, that they have been forced to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that the contrivers of <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> have been too haſty in framing them without a ſufficient number of Experiments; from whence we may conclude, that if Men will firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves to make Experiments in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to give a true Hiſtory of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature before they attempt to ſolve them upon their own Principles, the World will have an end before any. compleat Syſtem can be contrived to give any tolerable Account of them.</p>

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:61773:449"/>for their Creation, tho' his Wiſdom ſhould ſee it fit not to have them inhabited. For tho' every thing be equally eaſy for God to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, yet men are apt to admire the Works of this kind moſt. They employ the Wits of many Men in all Ages to conſider their End and Nature, and to calculate their Diſtances and Motions, whoſe Curioſity might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be very ill employed: there are ſome Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius's deſign'd, as it were, for theſe Studies, and they would want Matter to work upon without ſuch Objects.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. As the Satellites of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> and many of the fixt Stats were not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, till the Invention of Teleſcopes; ſo there are admirable Marks of Wiſdom in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Parts of Nature, which were never known till of late, and never could have been diſcovered, but by the help of Mycroſcopes. But Men are not the only Creatures, which are capable of praiſing and magnifying God for his wonderful Works: Angels, who know them more perfectly, do it much more; and they have need of no Artificial Inſtruments to make Diſcoveries of the Divine Wiſdom and Power.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. The Stars may be of great Benefit and Uſefulneſs in the World, tho' they neither have that Influence which Aſtrologers vainly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, nor are as Suns to other Earths: For they ſerve to keep the circumjacent Air or Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Motion, which otherwiſe would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61773:450"/>or ſtagnate; and to maintain that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Circulation or Fluid Matter, which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from Orb to Orb, through the Univerſe, and gives Life to all Things.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. Tho' this Earth be but ſmall in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the Ambient Heavens; yet the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of it, from the Beginning of the World to this time have been exceeding nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and may be ſtill vaſtly more numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before the end of it. And we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Earth, not as it is at one particular Time, but as it is the Seat of Mankind, and the Habitation of all Generations for all Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of Ages. And under this Notion the Earth is no ſuch contemptible Place, tho' it be very ſmall in reſpect of the Heavens that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round it. Nor is it ſtrange that the Material World, how capacious ſoever it be, ſhould be made for Mankind, to whom the Angels are <hi>Miniſtring Spirits,</hi> and for whom the Son of God himſelf was pleaſed to die.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. There are few or none of the Planets, but what by reaſon of their too near or too remote Diſtance from the Sun, ſeem incapable of being inhabited. M. <hi>Huygens</hi> in his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures concerning the Planetary Worlds,</hi> ſays, that this

                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 1.</note> Water of our Earth would in <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> be frozen up immediately, and in <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> it would be evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; and he concludes, that every Planet muſt have its <hi>Waters</hi> of ſuch a Temper, as to be proportioned to its Heat; <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:61773:450"/>
                        <hi>Saturn</hi>'s muſt be of ſuch a Nature, as not to be liable to Froſt, and <hi>Venus</hi>'s and <hi>Mercuries</hi> of ſuch, as not to be eaſily evaporated by the Sun. He ſays,
<note n="(xx)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 2.</note> That the Heat of the Sun is nine times greater in <hi>Mercury</hi> than with us: in <hi>Venus</hi> it is twice as hot as with us, the Light and Heat in <hi>Mars</hi> is twice, and ſometimes three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold leſs than ours. If there were any Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in <hi>Jupiter,</hi> they would have but the five and twentieth Part of the Light and Heat, that we receive from the Sun, and thoſe in <hi>Saturn</hi> but the hundreth Part. Upon which account he is very hard put to it to furniſh out Inhabitants for the reſt of the Planets: but as for the Moon, and the Satellites's moving about <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> he does as good as give up the Cauſe, by reaſon that they are neither Seas, nor Rivers, nor Clouds, nor Atmoſphere or Vapours, nor any kind of <hi>Water.</hi> Beſides, that the time of Light and Darkneſs in the Moon being equal to fifteen of our Days, if the Bodies of the Inhabitants were ſuch as ours are, he obſerves, that thoſe who had the Sun pretty high in their Horizon muſt be like to be burnt up in ſuch long days, and thoſe that liv'd under the Poles of the Moon, would be as much pinch'd with Cold; as our <hi>Whale fiſhers</hi> are about <hi>Ice-Land</hi> and <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> in the Summer-time. And the Summer and Winter in the Moons or Satellites of <hi>Saturn</hi> are fifteen Years long; and therefore they may well be concluded to be unhabitable: But becauſe it may be alledg'd,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:61773:451"/>that the ſame thing was believed of the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid and Torrid Zones, before Experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced Men of their Miſtake; and that, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, there may be other Planets or Earths yet undiſcovered, at convenient Diſtances from ſome of the fixt Stars: I obſerve, that tho it ſhould be granted, that ſome Planets be habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it doth not therefore follow, that they muſt be actually inhabited, or that ever they have been. For they might be deſign'd, if Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind had continued in Innocency, as Places for Colonies to remove Men to, as the World ſhould have encreaſed, either in Reward to thoſe that had excell'd in Vertue and Piety, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain them with the Proſpect of New and Better Worlds; and ſo by degrees, to advance them in proportion to their Deſerts, to the Heigth of Bliſs and Glory in Heaven; Or as a neceſſary Reception for Men (who would then have been immortal) after the Earth had been full of Inhabitants. And ſince the Fall and Mortality of Mankind, they may be either for Manſions of the Righteous, or Places of Puniſhment for the wicked, after the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, according as it ſhall pleaſe God, at the End of this World to new modify and transform them. And in the mean time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed at their reſpective Diſtances, they do by their ſeveral Motions contribute to keep the World at a Poiſe, and the ſeveral Parts of it at an <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> in their Gravitation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on each other, by Mr. <hi>Newton</hi>'s Principles.</p>

                     <p n="1">I. IT has been well obſerved by divers Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon this Subject, that the Scriptures were written with no deſign of Teaching us Natural Philoſophy, but to inſtruct us in the Knowledge of God and of our ſelves; to teach us our Duty, and ſhew us the way to live and die well: and therefore they might make uſe of Popular Expreſſions and Forms of Speech, neither affirming nor denying the Philoſophical Truth of them, but intending them only in that Senſe and Meaning, which was their ſole Deſign in uſing them. All proverbial Sayings and Metaphorical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions by way of Illuſtration or Ornament, muſt be taken from received Notions; but they are not therefore aſſerted in the Philoſophical Senſe by him, who uſeth them any more than the Hiſtorical Truth of Parables and Similitudes is ſuppoſed to be aſſerted. And to have made uſe only of Philoſophical Terms and

This Theory of Nature would beſides have ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſtrange and incredible to moſt Men, even as Miracles can do. For there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any thing that Men unacquainted with Philoſophy are more ſtartled at than Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Diſcoveries. How incredible doth the Motion of the Earth, and the reſt of the Sun ſeem to all Men but Philoſophers? Who are generally now agreed in it, whilſt the Riſing and Setting of the Sun are Expreſſions now as much in uſe with ſuch as hold the Earth's Motion, as with others: And indeed they muſt ſpeak ſo, if they will be underſtood, and excepting this one Inſtance, which is and ever will be in uſe according to the vulgar Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in all Countries and Languages, not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> withſtanding any Philoſophical Diſcoveries; I know nothing in the Scriptures, which is not conſiſtent with the preſent Notions of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.</p>

Yet the Sun and the Moon are not ſaid to be greater Lights than the fixt Stars, nor as great as they are: But are only called great Lights which they certainly are, tho' every Star ſhould be bigger than either of them.

                     <p>IT is ſufficient to prove the Reaſonableneſs of God's Proceedings with Mankind, if none are puniſhed, but thoſe that deſerve Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and none puniſhed more than they deſerve; and all are rewarded, who by a Faithful and Sincere, tho' but a very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience are become qualifyed for a Reward. God can do nothing but what is perfectly Juſt, and Infinitely Merciful, and we muſt be very unreaſonable, if we cavil at his Proceedings, which are conſiſtent not only with Juſtice and Equity, but with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it ſelf. For where neither his Juſtice nor his Mercy and Goodneſs interpoſe, we muſt ſurely acquieſce in the Divine Pleaſure, unl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſs we can think that God himſelf ſhould be
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61773:456"/>more confined in his Actions than Men are: For within the Limits of Juſtice and Mercy, it is certainly left at the Liberty of every Man in any Office or Authority, to do as he thinks fit. Yet as God is pleaſed in his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with Men, to appeal to their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the Equity of them; ſo there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in all his Proceedings with us, but it may be made appear to be more reaſonable, even according to the Notion that we have of things, than the contrary would have been.</p>
                     <p>It muſt de conſidered, that no Crated Being can in its own Nature be uncapable of Sin or Default, Becauſe it cannot be infinitely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; for it is inſeparable from all Creatures to have but finite Perſections, and whatever has bounds ſet to its Perefctions is in ſome reſpect imperſect, that is, it wants thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which a Being of Infinite Perfections alone can have. So that imperfection is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the very Eſſence of Created Beings, and what is imperfect may make Default. All inanimate things may deviate from the Regular courſe of their Natures, as they would certainly do, if the Divine Wiſdom and Power did not guide and maintain them in it. And every rational Being muſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have a Liberty of Choice, that is, it muſt have a Will to chuſe, as well as an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to Reaſon: For we have no notion how there can be Reaſon without Choice. A Faculty of Underſtanding without a Will to
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:61773:456"/>determine it, if left to it ſelf, muſt always think of the ſame Object, or proceed in a continued Series and Connexion of Thoughts, without any Aim or End, which would be a perpetual Labour in vain, and tedious Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to no purpoſe: But, if it ſhould be ſometimes determined by ſomething External to new Objects; yet, what uſe of Reaſon could there be in Contemplations, which were mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtruded and forced upon the Mind? And becauſe Rational Creatures muſt have ſome preſcribed Rule of their Actions, from which being free Agents, they may depart; they muſt in their own Nature be capable of Sin. God is Infinite Perfection, and therefore is a Rule to himſelf, and his Eſſence is uncapable of any other Rule of his Actions; he only Acts according to his Eſſence, from which it is impoſſible for him to vary. But the moſt perfect Creatures muſt act by a Rule, which is not eſſential to them, but preſcribed them by God, and is not ſo intrinſick to their Natures, but that they may decline from it, for a free Agent may follow or not follow the Rule appointed, or elſe it would not be free.</p>
                     <p>The Difficulty therefore is not, why Man was Created capable of Sinning; for he could not poſſibly by his Creation and in his Nature be uncapable of it; this is peculiar to God, who is infinite Perfection, that all Sin ſhould be a contradiction to His very Nature and Eſſence. But the Queſtion which has been
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:61773:457"/>ſtarted by ſome Men, if they State it right, muſt be this, How it came to paſs, that God did not ſuſtain and preſerve Men by an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible Power from falling into Sin, when Damnation was to be the conſequence of it? In anſwer to which, it might ſuffice to ſay, that in the Creation God muſt be ſuppoſed to act by His divine Prerogative, and by His ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Will and Power; <hi>He giveth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any of his Matters.</hi> Job xxxiii. 13. but it is enough for us to know, that he made Man happy, and capable of continuing happy, and that there could be no neceſſity, why he ſhould force him to continue ſo. Tho' we want not in the mean time Reaſons to prove, even to our weak and imperfect Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that it was expedient that the Happineſs or Miſery of Man ſhould depend upon his own Choice, rather than that he ſhould be kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably from all ſin, and be placed out of all poſſibility of Puniſhment and Miſery. I. Becauſe the Glory of God is hereby more advanced, and all the Attributes of His Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Juſtice, and Goodneſs are more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, than if Men had been inevitably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd from ſinning.

Unleſs Man had been left ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſinning againſt God, he could not have been in a Capacity of paying him a true and proper Obedience: for Obedience ſuppoſeth Choice, and Choice ſuppoſeth a Poſſibility of Diſobedience. To obey God in proper ſpeaking, is to chuſe to do what God has commanded, to ſubmit to his Will, and to reſolve to do what we know to be pleaſing to Him, upon that very Reaſon and Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, becauſe we know it to be His pleaſure; not becauſe the Neceſſity of our own Nature, or ſome over-ruling Power forceth us upon it.

To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Paſſions, and over rule all the Vices of Men, and ſet bounds to them; to bring Good out of Evil, and by unexpected Ways and Methods to lead Men to Repentance, and to appoint and bring to paſs the whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the Goſpel, by which the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Myſteries of the Divine Wiſdom are revealed, and ſuch things are diſcovered, as even the Angels themſelves <hi>deſire to look into.</hi> 1 Pet. i. 12. this magnifies the Wiſdom of God much more than the State of Men unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Sin could have done. There is much more Wiſdom ſhewn in governing Free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, than in governing by Fate and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and more Wiſdom in making the worſt Actions as inſtrumental and ſerviceable to the purpoſes of Holineſs and Goodneſs, as the beſt could have been, than in not ſuffering them to be, and more in Redeeming Man than in keeping him by Force in ſuch a Condition, as to ſtand in no need of Redemption.</p>
                     <p>All the Divine Attributes are much more magnified by the Incarnation of the Son of God for the Redemption of Man, than they could have been, if he had never fall'n: The Love of God is manifeſted in a more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61773:458"/>manner by ſending His own Son to die for us; His Juſtice in requiring Satisfaction, and His Wiſdom, and Truth, and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in recovering Man from his miſerable Condition, and perfecting the Deſign of his Creation, in deſpight of his Diſobedience.</p>
                     <p>It is the Mercy of God to ſave them that are ſaved; but his Juſtice is executed only upon the wicked; and why ſhould we think it reaſonable, that God ſhould debar himſelf the exerciſe of one of his Attributes rather than puniſh ſuch Men, as thro' their own Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy will periſh? Juſtice is as much a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of God as Mercy is; and tho' it may ſeem terrible to us, yet it is as reaſonable in it ſelf, that wicked Men ſhould periſh, as that the righteous ſhould be ſaved: And God acts upon Principles of infinite Reaſon and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, without any mixture of Paſſion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I demand, Is it reaſonable or not, that the wicked ſhould ſuffer? And if it be, why ſhould not God act according to his own Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, and the true Reaſons of things, rather than by our weak and fond Paſſions? Since there is infinite Wiſdom, and Juſtice, and Mercy in God's Proceedings, it cannot be conceived, why the Ruine which many Men will bring upon themſelves, ſhould either alter or hinder the Divine Counſels and Decrees.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. A freedom of Choice conduceth more to the Happineſs of the Bleſſed, than a Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of not ſinning could have done. The
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:61773:459"/>Happineſs of Heaven conſiſts in the Love and Enjoyment of God; but Love is never ſo great, nor ſo ſenſible an Happineſs, as when there has been ſome Tryal and Experience in the proof of it. And it muſt advance the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs both of Angels and Men in Heaven, that upon Choice and Tryal they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd God before all things, and upon that find themſelves confirm'd and Eſtabliſhed in the perpetual and unalterable Love and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him. This very Conſideration, that they might once have fall'n from his Love, inſpires them with the higheſt Ardors of Love, when they rejoyce in the infinite Rewards of ſo eaſy and ſhort a Tryal: and the Reflection upon the Dangers eſcaped, heightens even the Joys of Heaven it ſelf to them, and makes an Addition to every degree of Bliſs. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their paſt Sins and Temptations, and the Senſe of their own Unworthineſs ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that Remembrance, will continually excite in the bleſſed freſh Acts of Love and Adoration of God, who has raiſed them above all Sin and Temptation, and fixt them in an everlaſting State of Bliſs and Glory. The Tryal that the Righteous underwent here makes up ſome part of their Happineſs in Heaven, and in what degree ſoever their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs can be ſuppoſed to be, yet it is in ſome meaſure encreaſed, and, as it were, endeared to them by reflecting upon their former State of Tryal, which they were ſubject to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation and Sin.</p>

                     <p>The Love and Praiſes, and Adorations of the Father for ſending his Son and accepting his Ranſem of the Son, as our bleſſed Saviour and Redeemer, and of the Holy Ghoſt as our Guide and Conductor to Heaven, muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that we needed a Ranſom and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and the Grace and Influence of the Holy Ghoſt; that is, we muſt have been ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Sin and Miſery, or elſe we had want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe Motives to the Love of God, which the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel affords, and which will make up the Happineſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us. Creatures cannot comprehend the Divine Eſſence, but they know and love God, according as he manifeſts himſelf to them; and therefore that Diſpenſation, which doth moſt manifeſt the Love and Wiſdom, and Goodneſs of God, doth moſt conduce to the Glory of God and the Happineſs of Men. The Bleſſed ſhall ſee God <hi>face to face,</hi> they ſhall enjoy his Preſence and partake of his Glory, and in this their Happineſs will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; but the Love of God is not only the neceſſary conſequence of this Beafitick Viſion, but it is antecedently neceſſary to qualify us for it, and the more any Soul is inflamed with the Divine Love, the fuller and more perfect Viſion of God we muſt ſuppoſe it to enjoy. But Goodneſs is the Object of our Love, and not Goodneſs in the Idea ſo much, as Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs extended to us: And as God's Goodneſs is more manifeſted in ſending his Son to atone
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:61773:460"/>for our Sins, than it could have been by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empting us from all poſſibility of Sinning; ſo our Love to him muſt be more ſtrongly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, whereby the Soul is dilated, as it were, and made more receptive of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Divine Eſſence in the Beatifick Viſion. As Faith is <hi>made perfect by Works</hi> proceeding from Love in this Life, and without Charity is nothing worth; ſo in the other World, where Faith ſhall be ſwallowed up in Viſion, Love muſt be that Power or Quality in the Soul, whereby we become ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving the Divine Communications, and the more extentive and boundleſs this is, the more happy we ſhall be; and therefore, whatever is moſt conducing to advance the Love of God in us, is the beſt means of our Salvation and future Happineſs.</p>
                     <p>The Motives which the Chriſtian Religion affords us, to the Praiſe and Love of God, will accompany us for ever to augment and improve the Happineſs, even of Heaven it ſelf, where <hi>Charity never fails:</hi> and it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable how the Divine Love could have been ſo fully manifeſted, and ſet forth to us ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, if Man had never fall'n, but by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to him the Danger of his Fall, and the gracious Deſign of God towards him, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing he had fall'n. To have eſcaped Hell, and to find our ſelves in the unchangeable Poſſeſſion of Salvation by the free Mercy and Goodneſs of God, and by the Death of his
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:61773:460"/>own Son, are Thoughts which muſt create a new Heaven, as it were, in Heaven it ſelf; I mean, they will enlarge our Souls to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Capacities of our Natures, and fill and actuate them with ſuch Divine Ardors of Love, as if we had been kept neceſſarily from all Sin, ſeem impoſſible to have been raiſed in us. The Angels themſelves <hi>rejoyce over one Sinner that repenteth,</hi> and that Joy muſt have been wanting to them, who are of ſo much higher and more excellent a Nature than we are of, if there had been no Poſſibility either of Sin, or of Repentance. And the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diſpenſation of the Goſpel is an eternal Subject of Praiſe and Adoration, an eternal Fountain of Love, and Joy, and Happineſs to all the Bleſſed Spirits in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>The more the Divine Attributes are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, the more Adorable the Majeſty of God will appear, and will become the greater Object of our Praiſe and Veneration; thoſe that are wiſe and good will be made the wiſer and better by it, and the happier in the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divine Perfections. Now a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour in his Laws, and in the Method and Order of his Government, has regard chiefly to the Good and Obedient, and has little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the reſt. And we muſt conſider God not only as the Father, but as the Governour of Mankind; and tho' an earthly Father per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps would by all means poſſible preſerve his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore if the Liberty of Choice in Men, and the Poſſibility of their Sin and Damnation be for the Glory of God, and for the Benefit of good Men, and be no Injury to the Bad; this is a ſufficient Account, why man was not neceſſarily reſtrained from Sinning, tho' Damnation be the conſequence of it.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>IN the Beginning God created every thing perfect in its kind, and endned the Angels and Man with all intellectual and Moral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections ſuitable to their reſpective Natures: but ſo as to leave them capable of ſinning. For it pleaſed the infinite Wiſdom of God (for the Reaſons already alledg'd, and for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, and greater Reaſons perhaps than any man is able to imagine) to place them in a State of Tryal, and to put it to their own Choice, whether they would ſtand in their preſent Condition of Innocence and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61773:461"/>in which they were created, or fall into Sin and Miſery. We have little or no Account in the Scriptures of the Cauſe or Temptation, which occaſioned the Fall of Angels, becauſe it doth not concern us to be acquainted with it; and therefore it little becomes us to be inquiſitive about it. Indeed it is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to conceive, how Beings of ſo Great Knowledge and Purity, as the Fall'n Angels once were of, ſhould fall into Sin: But it muſt be conſidered, that nothing is more unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table than the Motives and Cauſes of Action in Free Agents: when any Being is at Liberty to do as it will, no other Reaſon beſides its own Will need be enquir'd for, of its Actings. What is liable to Sin, may ſin, whatever the Motive be; and to enquire after the Motive, is to enquire what Motives may determine a Free Agent, that is, an Agent, which may determine it ſelf upon any Ground or Motive.</p>
                     <p>But how perfect and excellent ſoever any Creature is, unleſs it be ſo confirmed and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in a State of Purity and Holineſs, as to be ſecured from all poſſibility of Sinning, it may be ſuppoſed to admire it ſelf, and dote upon its own Perfections and Excellencies, and by degrees, to neglect and not acknowledge God the Author of them, but to ſin and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell againſt Him. And it is moſt agreeable both to Scripture and Reaſon, that Pride was the cauſe of the Fall of Angels. For thoſe
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61773:462"/>Excellencies which might ſecure them from any other Sin proved a Temptation to this, and the greater their Perfections were, the greater was the Temptation; as in a Man who is guilty of Spiritual and Phariſaical Pride, all that is good and commendable in him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords him only matter for his Sin. So that where there is a freedom of Will and a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of Sinning, the very Perfection of Nature in a Creature may be made an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſin; and that which excludes other ſins may prove a Motive and Temptation to Pride, which therefore we have reaſon to conclude was the Sin of the Fall'n Angels.</p>
                     <p>As to the Fall of Man, however the Thing may be diſputed, the Effects of it are viſible in the ſtrange Proneneſs of Humane Nature, to act againſt Reaſon and Conſcience, that is, to act in plain contradiction to it ſelf, and its own Principles. This is a State in which it cannot be ſuppoſed, that Mankind was at firſt created by the infinitely Good and Holy God. And the moſt plauſible Opinion, and that which has moſt generally obtained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Heathens,</hi> is, that the Souls of Men had a Being before they came into this World, and were ſent into Human Bodies in Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for what they had done amiſs in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent State. But this is mere ſuſpicion and Conjecture without any poſſibility of Proof, and there is this plain Reaſon againſt it, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o man can be puniſhed for his Amendment,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:61773:462"/>who knows nothing of it. For it is inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the Nature and end of Puniſhment, that the Offender ſhould not be made ſenſible of his Fault, eſpecially when the Puniſhment is deſigned for his Amendment, as it is ſaid to be in the preſent Caſe.</p>
                     <p>If it can be ſuppoſed, that Men may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly retain no Remembrance of what they did in another State, yet if their Faults were not kept in Memory, they ſhould be brought to their Remembrance, if this Life were deſigned as a State of Puniſhment in order to Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the State of this Life is ſo far from being thought a Puniſhment, that Men natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are of nothing more fond, nor dread any thing more than to leave it. And tho' Men meet with great Afflictions here, yet thoſe do not befall thoſe only or chiefly, who by their Proneneſs to Evil in this Life, might be ſuppoſed to have been the greateſt Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in a former State, and every Calamity has not the Nature of Puniſhment. The Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Miſeries which we endure by reaſon of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion are not ſo properly Puniſhments as the Effects and Conſequences of his ſin: But Perſonal Faults ſuch as are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been committed in a State of pre-exiſtence require a proper Puniſhment, and if the Puniſhment be for Amendment, as it is ſuppoſed to be in this preſent State, both the Fault and the Puniſhment muſt be known, with the Cauſe and End of its being

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Eve</hi> was beguiled by the Serpent, and <hi>Adam</hi> was enticed by her. It is not to be ſuppoſed, but that the Devil would uſe all the Means that the ſubtilty of his Malice could invent, to procure the Ruine of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and that therefore he would not only make uſe of inward Suggeſtions, but of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Allurements alſo by a viſible ſhape and Appearance. And if he had aſſumed the ſhape of a Man or Woman; <hi>Eve</hi> knew that there was none of Human Kind but <hi>Adam</hi> and her ſelf in the World, and therefore that Shape was leaſt of all proper for him to make uſe of.

                     <p n="2">2. The Sin committed by our Firſt Parents was in eating the forbidden Fruit, and they both eating of it, fell thereby from their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive State of Happineſs. The time when our Firſt Parents ſinned is uncertain, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no ground for the Objection, which ſome have framed by crowding a long ſeries of things into the Buſineſs of one day. Many Circumſtances are omitted in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures concerning the State of our Firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in Paradiſe, and relating to their Fall. For no more is mentioned than was needful to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Deſign, which was to give a very brief Account of the moſt remarkable things that had paſt from the Creation to his own Times. It appears that our Firſt Parents were no ſtrangers to the Preſence and Voice of God, and there is no reaſon to doubt but that they were fully inſtructed in the Terms propoſed to them, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of God's Commandments, how much depended upon their Obedience, what danger they were in, and how eaſily they might eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape it, and become enſtated in Everlaſting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and Happineſs.</p>
                     <p>God had determined to make Tryal of them
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:61773:465"/>by purpoſing an eaſy inſtance of their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and by forbidding them the uſe of but one Tree in Paradiſe: It was but a ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, and they had Ability enough to have overcome the greateſt Temptation, and Life, and Death were ſet before them, as the Reward or Puniſhment of their Obedience or Diſobedience, upon eating the forbidden Fruit, they muſt <hi>ſurely die;</hi> but if they had but refrained from it, another Tree was provided, the eating of which ſhould as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have made them Immortal, as this made them ſubject to Death: For then without ever undergoing Death, they ſhould have been tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated to a State of more perfect Bliſs and Happineſs.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be deny'd, but that it was very fitting and reaſonable, that God ſhould lay ſome Reſtraint upon our Firſt parents, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might be obeyed, and his Soveraignty acknowledg'd: And as no Law could be more eaſily obſerv'd than this, ſo it was moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the place in which they were, and for their manner of Life and State of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. The common Rules and Laws of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality could then ſcarce have any place, but it was requiſite that this or ſome ſuch other Inſtance of Obedience, ſhould be impoſed. Theft, and Murder, and Adultery, and other Sins againſt Moral Duties were then either impoſſible to be committed, or ſo unnatural, that it can hardly be imagined, how any of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:61773:465"/>them ſhould be committed, when there were yet but two Perſons in the World, in a State of perfect Innocence: and therefore in Moral Duties there could be no Tryal of the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of our Firſt parent; beſides, theſe were ſo well known to them, that there could be no need of any Command concerning them. But God gives them a Command in a Thing of an indifferent Nature, that ſo he might have a plainer proof of their Obedience, in a thing which was both indifferent of it ſelf, and ſo eaſy to them, that nothing but a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and perverſe Neglect could betray them into Diſobedience. To ſuppoſe Good and Evil to be in the Nature of Things only, and not in the Commandments and Prohibitions of God, is in effect, a renouncing of God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; but this Tree was the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil: For it made them ſenſible of the Divine Authority upon which Moral Good and Evil formally depend, tho' matterially they be in the Nature of Things: Whatever God is pleaſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or forbid, however indifferent it be in it ſelf, is for that very Reaſon, ſo far as it is commanded or forbidden by him, as truly Good or Evil, as if it were abſolutely and morally ſo, being enacted by the ſame Divine Authority, whereby all Moral Precepts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come obligatory as Laws to us; for all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Truths, or Precepts, or Rules of Life, however certain and neceſſary in themſelves,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:61773:466"/>yet receive the Obligation of Laws from the Divine Authority, this being the moſt certain Truth in Morality, and in order of Nature an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to all others, that God is to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all that he commands or forbids. But the Divine Authority was ſolely and purely concern'd in this Commandment, which had no foundation in the Nature of Things, but depended meerly upon the Will and Pleaſure of God, and by the Tranſgreſſion of this Law, it became notorious to our Firſt parents and their unhappy Poſterity, that both Good and Evil, whatever they may be in Speculation and abſtracted Notions, yet as they concern us in the Practice of our Lives, are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd ultimately into the Divine Authority; God is our Lawgiver, and nothing can be a Law to us but by His enacting, and what he enacts muſt be a Law to us; and of the ſame neceſſary indſpenſable Obligation, ſo far as he is pleaſed to enjoyn it, whether it be a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Precept, or only an indifferent Thing in its own Nature. It ſeems then that God was pleaſed to manifeſt his Soveraign Authority in this Commandment, and to ſhew that it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and independant upon Moral Good or Evil; and that tho' his infinite Holineſs and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would not permit him to Command any thing contrary to Moral Duties, nor ſuffer him not to command Moral Good, and forbid Moral Evil; yet his Authority is arbitrary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, extending as far beyond all the Duties
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:61773:466"/>of Morality as he pleaſes, which indeed are only Truths and Precepts, but not Duties to us but by Vertue of his Authority. This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment therefore was given in Aſſertion of God's Authority, whom it is always and in every thing good to obey, and evil to diſobey, as our Firſt parents found by ſad Experience.

                     <p n="2">2. Our Firſt Parents were turned out of Paradiſe, and not ſuffered to taſte of the Tree of Life. They had been charged not to eat of the Fruit in the midſt of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and Threatned with Death, that is, that they ſhould become Mortal, and be ſure to die, if they would preſume to eat of it. To be ſubject to Miſery both in Body and Mind, ſo that the Body ſhould decay, and at laſt be diſſolved, and the Soul which could not Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh ſhould be miſerable after its ſeparation from the Body, was the Original Notion of Death; and our Firſt Parents, who had never feen what Natural dying was, underſtood Death no otherwiſe than as a Privation of Happineſs, and conſequently a State of Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry both in this Life and the next: The firſt was unavoidable, the latter to be avoided by Repentance, and a future Obedience thro' Faith in God's Mercy for Chriſt's ſake.</p>
                     <p>They were hindred from taſting of that Tree which was to have been the Means and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Immortality to them. For God who has given a Medicinal Vertue and a Power of Nouriſhment to other Fruits and Herbs, might convey a Power and Influence into this Tree, of rendring Men Immortal by preventing the decays of Nature, and Nouriſhing or Streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thning
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:61773:468"/>them to an endleſs Life. How this ſhould have been, we are now no more able to know than to become immortal here upon Earth: But this was God's Decree, that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality ſhould be annext to the taſting of that Tree, and therefore our Firſt Parents, when they had incurred the Penalty of Death, were not ſuffered to taſte of it, but were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of Paradiſe, and it was juſt that they ſhould be hindred from enjoying any longer the Delights of Paradiſe, for the Tranſgreſſion of a Commandment, which wantonneſs only and a vain and criminal Curioſity, could make them diſobey.</p>

But ſince God has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued our ordinary Food with a power of Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, no man can reaſonably doubt but that he might endue this Fruit with ſuch a Vertue, that it ſhould have made men immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to Taſte of it, and have prevented that decay of Nature, which now ſtill creeps upon us in the uſe of other Food. We may well ſuppoſe, that if they had once taſted of this Fruit,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:61773:469"/>they ſhould have ſuffered no Decay, but have lived in conſtant Vigour here, tho' partaking afterwards only of other Nouriſhment, till they had been tranſlated to Heaven. Or it might be deſign'd not as a Phyſical, but a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Cauſe of Immortality, that is, as a Sign and Pledge of Immortality, God having decreed that upon the Taſting of this Fruit, <hi>Adam</hi> and his Poſterity ſhould have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal. But the Forbidden Fruit being of a moſt delicious Taſte, as well <hi>as pleaſant to the Eyes,</hi> and containing a very fermenting Juice, might put the Blood and Spirits into great Diſorder, and thereby diveſt the Soul of that Power and Dominion which it had before over the Body, and by a cloſer and more intimate Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Matter, might reduce it to that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Condition, which has been propagated and derived down to Poſterity with the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature from our Firſt Parents; as ſome Poyſons now ſtrangely affect the Nerves and Spirits, without cauſing immediate Death, but make ſuch Alterations in the Body, as are never to be cured. And it could not be fitting that Man ſhould become immortal in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or that the Threatning of God, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhould not take place.</p>
                     <p>From what has been hitherto ſaid upon this Subject, I hope it is evident, that there can be no neceſſity of running to Allegorical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations to explain the Fall of our Firſt Parents. And indeed all the Reaſon that can
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:61773:469"/>be given, why it is repreſented under an Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, will rather prove the Litteral Senſe. For if the Simplicity, and the Cuſtoms, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Life in the Beginning of the World did require, that the Fall of our Firſt parents ſhould be deſcrib'd under an Allegory of this Nature; for the very ſame Reaſons we may ſuppoſe that the Fall was in this manner. For what is it which makes it ſeem improbable, but only its being diſagreeable, as ſome Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, to Reaſon? But if it be abſurd to ſuppoſe that ſuch a thing ſhould have been in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World, why is it not as abſurd that ſuch a thing ſhould be repreſented to thoſe, who liv'd at the beginning of the World, as if it had been? If this was then the moſt fitting and proper Repreſentation of the Fall, why was it not the moſt likely manner for it to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by? God's Diſpenſations are always fitted to the Capacities and Circumſtances of thoſe, who are moſt concern'd in them, and the Devil in his Temptations applies himſelf to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of thoſe, whom he would ſeduce: And it cannot be conceiv'd, that the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Thing that ever has befaln Mankind (except the Redemption of the World by Chriſt) ſhould ſo come to paſs, as not to be told to Poſterity, but in an Allegory. For if the Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Truth had ever been known, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it ſhould be forgotten in ſo few Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould put an Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the room of it. Did the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> know the Hiſtorical Truth of the Fall,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:61773:470"/>or did they not know it? If they did, why ſhould <hi>Moſes</hi> diſguiſe it under an Allegory, rather than the reſt of the Book of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis?</hi> If they did not know it, how could it be forgotten in ſo few Generations of Men, ſuppoſing it had ever been known to <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity? If it were never known, but the Relation of it were always conveyed down in <hi>Metaphor</hi> and <hi>Allegory,</hi> then this <hi>Allegory</hi> muſt paſs for Hiſtorical Truth in thoſe Ages; and the Reaſon why it was delivered to them in <hi>Allegory,</hi> muſt be, becauſe that manner of delivering it, was moſt ſuitable to that Age, and moſt credible, and every way moſt proper; and if it were moſt fitting that it ſhould be thought to have happened ſo, this is a good Argument that it did really happen ſo, since there is nothing hinders, but it might ſo have happened, and it was moſt probable at leaſt to the firſt Ages of the World, that it did ſo come to paſs, or elſe it would not have been requiſite to relate it in this manner.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Fall of our Firſt Parents brought a Curſe upon their Poſterity. And here it muſt be acknowledg'd, that God may beſtow his infinite Grace and Mercies upon what Terms he pleaſeth, and therefore he might ordain, that the Happineſs or Unhappineſs of their Poſterity ſhould depend upon the Obedience or Diſobedience of our Firſt Parents.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) God might ordain that the Condition of their Poſterity in this World ſhould depend
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:61773:470"/>upon it, ſo that they ſhould have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal upon their Obedience, and ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come mortal upon their Diſobedience; that they ſhould be made ſubject to Cares and Labours, to Diſeaſes and Dangers by reaſon of the Fall of our Firſt Parents, from which, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they ſhould have been exempt. This is eſteem'd juſt in all Governments amongſt Men, that Children ſhould be reduced to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and Diſgrace by the Fault of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, from whom Riches and Honour were to have deſcended upon them: And this way of Proceeding is juſt, both in Humane Laws and in the Diſpenſations of Providence; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God and our Country have an antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Right and Intereſt in us, ſuperior to any Man's private Title or Welfare; and this they may juſtly make uſe of to reſtrain Men from thoſe Crimes, out of Love and Concern for their Poſterity, from which no conſideration of themſelves could have with held them. The Experience of the World has found this to be the moſt effectual Remedy with many Men, and therefore the wiſeſt and juſteſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments have made uſe of it, and the moſt wiſe and juſt God might think fit to deal in this manner with our Firſt Parents, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to them, that the Happineſs or Miſery of their Poſterity depended upon their Good or ill Behaviour in this one Inſtance of their Duty. We daily ſee that Children common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inherit the Diſeaſes of their Parents, and an
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:61773:471"/>extravagant and vicious Father leaves his Son Heir to nothing but the Name and Shadow perhaps of a Great Family, with an infirm and ſickly Conſtitution, and little or nothing to ſupport and relieve it. Now if theſe Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Calamities had been entail'd upon all the Race of Mankind from <hi>Adam,</hi> the thing would have been the ſame in the Nature and Juſtice of it (for Numbers cannot alter the Nature of Things) as it is now, when they deſcend upon ſome, only from their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Parents. And therefore it muſt be much rather juſt, that the Fall of our Firſt Parents ſhould make their whole Race only <hi>liable</hi> to ſuch Calamities, but not involve All neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in them.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) The Communications of God's Grace, and the Favours and Bleſſings of his more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Preſence, might depend upon the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of the Firſt Parents of Mankind. He might ſend them out of Paradiſe, and might withdraw his free and uſual Communications of himſelf from them and their Poſterity, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Forfeiture, by their Diſobedience.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Proneneſs which we cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in our ſelves to Sin might proceed from hence. We daily ſee and feel the corruption of our Nature, by whatſoever means we became ſubject to it. So that it is in vain to object, that it would be unjuſt that all Mankind ſhould be involv'd in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin. For the Condition which we are in, is matter of Fact,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:61773:471"/>of which no man doth or can doubt: The Queſtion is only, how we come into this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and ſince we are born in it; and it is our Natural and Hereditary evil, the Juſtice and Goodneſs of God is cleared and vindicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by aſſigning a Cauſe for it; from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of ſuch as muſt acknowledge the ſame corruption of Nature, but will allow no Cauſe or Reaſon for it, except the arbitrary Will and Pleaſure of the Creator. The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of vicious Parents are generally moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to Vice, and if Men may partake of the evil Diſpoſitions and Inclinations of their more immediate Parents, why might not the Corruption of the Humane Nature in our Firſt Parents deſcend upon all their Poſterity?</p>
                     <p n="4">(4.) The Happineſs of Men in the next Life might depend upon the Obedience of our Firſt Parents. For when God propoſed to beſtow upon Men Rewards of Glory and Happineſs, which far ſurpaſs any Pretences of Deſert or Claim of Right, that they in a State of Righteouſneſs and Innocency could have been able to make, ſince the Promiſes were ſo great and the Happineſs ſo far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding any thing to which Men could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a Right; we muſt be very unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unleſs we will confeſs that God might beſtow his own Gifts upon his own Terms. He might therefore debar Men from Heaven upon the Tranſgreſſion o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> our Firſt Parents, becauſe the Promiſe of Heaven was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n act
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:61773:472"/>of his free Bounty. For no Man can pretend that an Innocent Creature which preſerves its Integrity, muſt, for that Reaſon, be advanced to the unſpeakable Joys of Heaven. No Creature can be <hi>profitable</hi> to his Maker, and an <hi>unprofitable Servant</hi> can merit no ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. And what God was not obliged to beſtow, tho' Men continued in the State of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, he might with all the Juſtice and Reaſon in the World refuſe, when Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came diveſted of their Innocency, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by forfeited all pretences to that Happineſs which was promiſed upon condition, that our Firſt Parents had continued in their Primitive and Original State of Righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p n="5">(5.) God might ordain that all Men ſhould become liable to Eternal Miſery by the Fall of our Firſt Parents, and that thoſe who would not accept of Means appointed of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Faith in Chriſt, to reſcue them from it, ſhould periſh eternally. We no ſooner read of the Fall of Man, but Chriſt is forthwith promiſed, even before the Curſe was denounced upon <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> for their Offence; the Seed of the Woman is immediately promiſed to bruiſe the Sepents Head, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Judgment is denounced, firſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Eve</hi> and then upon <hi>Adam</hi> for their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; and the Seed of the Womans brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Serpent's Head, is to be underſtood of Victory over our Spiritual Enemies, and that Conqueſt which ſhould be obtained over
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:61773:472"/>Death and Hell by Chriſt. For the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Puniſhment which was to befall <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> and their Poſterity, is afterwards added, and therefore this Promiſe cannot be underſtood of a Deliverance from that, but from the wrath of God, and of Redemption from Sin upon Repentance under whatever condition of this Life.</p>
                     <p>The Conſequence of the Sin of our Firſt Parents is to entail Grief, and Trouble, and Labour, and Pain upon their Poſterity, and a frail and infirm Nature, expoſed to Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and deſtitute of the Aids of Grace, and the preſence of God in their Hearts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Heaven, and in no capacity of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding Hell without Chriſt's Merits. But Chriſt was at that very time promiſed to take away all the Curſe and Vengeance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent upon the Tranſgreſſion of our Firſt Parents, nay, his Death was pre-ordained and determined beforehand. For Chriſt is <hi>the Lamb Slain from the Foundation of the World,</hi> Rev. xiii. 8. <hi>Who verily was fore ordained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Foundation of the World.</hi> 1 Pet. i. 20. He was Slain in the determinate Counſel, and fore-knowledge of God, even before the Fall of our Firſt Parents came to paſs: the whole Scheme and Deſign of Man's Salvation was laid from all Eternity in God's Counſel and Decree, he foreſaw that Man would fall, and he determined to ſend his Son to redeem him, and this he had determined to do ſo long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:61773:473"/>the Fall of Man, even by an eternal Decree. So that the Goodneſs and Wiſdom of God had effectually provided againſt the ill conſequences, to the Salvation of Mankind by the Fall in all that obey him; and made it impoſſible that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come eternally Miſerable, and Tormented in Hell Fire, but through their own Fault. For tho' we learn from the Scriptures, that Infants are <hi>by Nature born in Sin, and the Children of Wrath,</hi> yet, whatever the Effects of that Wrath may be, we have no Ground to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that any one ſhall be condemned, to the Flames and Pains of Hell, without his own Perſonal and Actual Guilt. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the World by Chriſt was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed from Eternity, and was actually promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before any Child of <hi>Adam</hi> was born, and even before the Curſe was denounced upon our Firſt Parents, and a Remedy was from the beginning provided againſt all that Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which was brought upon Mankind by their Tranſgreſſion.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THere is nothing in Religion which has been thought by many, more liable to
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:61773:473"/>Objections than the Eternity of Hell Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And yet I ſhall undertake to prove that they are plainly conſiſtent, not only with the Juſtice, but with the Equity and Mercy of God.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. I ſhall prove the Eternity of Hell Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be conſiſtent with the Juſtice of God from theſe Arguments. 1. Becauſe both Rewards and Puniſhments are alike propoſed to our Choice. 2. Becauſe the Rewards are Eternal as well as the Puniſhments. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was neceſſary that the Sanction of the Divine Laws ſhould be by Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments. (4) Becauſe it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that Eternal Puniſhments ſhould be infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon the Wicked, according to this San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Both Rewards and Puniſhments are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like propoſed to our Choice. It is certainly conſiſtent with Infinite Juſtice, to ſet before Men Life and Death, Bleſſing and Curſing, and then to deal with them according to their own Choice. And none will fall into a State of Everlaſting Miſery, but ſuch as ſhall be convinced in their own Conſciences of the Juſtice of God's Proceedings with them: And this conviction will prove one great part of their Puniſhment, when they ſhall conſider that they Periſh only by their own Fault, that they were wilful and obſtinate to their own Ruine; that no Promiſes, no
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:61773:474"/>Threats could reclaim them. And this is all that the ſtricteſt Juſtice can require, to deal with Men according to their own Choice, to let them chuſe their own Condition of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or Miſery, and to proceed in ſuch a manner with Sinners, as that they ſhall be convinced themſelves that there is no Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice done them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Rewards are Eternal as well as the Puniſhments. If the Rewards on the one hand had not born a juſt proportion to the Puniſhments on the other, the Cauſe had been different, and it had ſeemed hard to ſuffer Eternal Torments for a ſhort Life of Sin, if there had not been Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs propoſed to as ſhort a Life of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Righteouſneſs. But ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and the Puniſhments are equal, it is not neceſſary that there ſhould be an exact proportion between the Offence and the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment conſidered in it ſelf, and without reſpect had to the Rewards; becauſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward being Eternal, anſwers the oppoſite Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment on the other Part. Thus Men are wont to ſet ſo much Leſs againſt ſo much Gain; and no Man pities him that might have gained as much as he has loſt, if it had not been his own Fault, tho' the loſs be never ſo great, and depended upon never ſo ſmall and ſhort a Tryal.</p>
                     <p>It may ſeem an hard Caſe, that a Man ſhould loſe his Life for but going out of a
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:61773:474"/>City, when he could do no hurt by it, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to do any: and this was the Caſe of <hi>Shimei;</hi> but he had forfeited his Life before to <hi>David,</hi> who had ſpar'd; and he had been afterwards engag'd, it ſeems, in other ill Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, and had probably been concern'd with <hi>Joab</hi> and others in ſetting up <hi>Adonijah,</hi> (for it was another <hi>Shimei,</hi> the Son of <hi>Elah,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, that he was not with <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nijah.</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> i. 8. iv. 18.) and <hi>David</hi> gives <hi>Solomon</hi> the ſame Direction concerning theſe two Men. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> ii. 5, 8. <hi>Solomon</hi> therefore ſets him this Condition, and he was to expect to live upon no other Terms, but his keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within theſe Bounds, which by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of <hi>Shimei</hi> himſelf was a <hi>good ſaying.</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> ii. 38. that is, he was glad of it, and could expect no kinder Uſage. And if <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> had propoſed ſome great Reward to him, upon Condition, that he had kept within the City, he had been not only juſt, but very gracious and bountiful to him in it. I am confident any condemn'd Malefactor would think ſo. The Caſe of Mankind is like this, but infinitely more gracious on God's part, and more provoking on ours. The very beſt of us were in Sin, and have often forfeited our Salvation to the Divine Juſtice; and God by his Sovereign Power and Authority over us might have propoſed any Terms of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation: But he has been pleaſed to appoint, that our everlaſting State of Happineſs or
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:61773:475"/>Miſery ſhould depend upon the Moral Terms of Vertue and Vice, and to ſet everlaſting Happineſs <hi>againſt</hi> everlaſting Miſery; and no man <hi>ſhall be</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to Hell Torments, but he might have been as happy as he ſhall find himſelf to be miſerable.</p>

                        <hi>Heathens</hi> had a Notion of eternal Rewards and Puniſhments, as well as Chriſtians; and the eternity of the latter was the great Impediment, which <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi> endeavour'd to remove out of the way, to the free Enjoyment of Men's Luſts. For whatever ſome have ſaid in behalf of <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> his own word produced
<note n="(x)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Tuſc.</hi> Qu. lib. iii.</note> by <hi>Tully,</hi> too plain to be evaded, ſhew, that he did place all Happineſs in ſenſual Pleaſures, only he was willing to enjoy them as quietly and ſecurely as he could, and for this Reaſon laid down divers Rules by way of expedient to keep the Mind in Peace, void of all Auxiety in this Life, and of all Hopes or Fears of a future State: The prevailing Belief of the eternal Puniſhments of wicked Men after Death was enough to ruine all his Philoſophy; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this was by all means to be removed, which yet he was never able to effect. So that this was a thing ſufficiently known to make all men ſenſible of what they muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect would be the conſequence of Sin. And what God has threatned ſo long before, and has given Men time, and Opportunity, and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to avoid, they cannot fall under, but thro' their own Wilfulneſs and Misbehaviour, and
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:61773:475"/>can have no reaſon to complain, when it comes upon them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It was neceſſary that the Sanction of the Divine Laws ſhould be by eternal Rewards and Puniſhments. The Sanction of all Laws is by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments, and the Deſign of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing Puniſhments is to affright Men from Sin, as the end of Rewards is to invite them to Obedience. The only true Meaſure and juſt Proportion therefore between the Crime and the Puniſhment, is the ſuitableneſs of the Puniſhment to enforce Obedience to the Law, and cauſe it to be duly obſerved. For if the Law be good and neceſſary, and cannot be ſo well and ſo effectually obeyed without a very ſevere Puniſhment to enforce it; the Severity of the Puniſhment is ſo far from Cruelty, that it is a juſt and wiſe Proviſion to ſecure Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law, and procure all the Good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd by it. Thus we always judge in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws: A man is condemn'd to loſe his Life for taking from another that, which he perhaps could very well ſpare; but we are all agreed in the Juſtice of making ſuch Examples, becauſe we find that Men can ſcarce be ſecure in their Lives and Eſtates, notwithſtanding the Severity of ſuch Laws. And if the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of everlaſting Torments will not frighten Men from Sin, what effect would a leſs Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment denounced have had upon them? If men can but once perſwade themſelves that the Torments of Hell are not ſo terrible, they free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:61773:476"/>give themſelves up to all Licentiouſneſs; and we know how fond Men of wicked Lives are of ſuch Doctrines. God therefore perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtanding the Temper and Inclination, the Stubborneſs and Perverſeneſs of Mens Hearts, ſo prone to Vice, and ſo backward to all that is good; foreſaw that a leſs Puniſhment threatned would not prevail with Men to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their Sins, and get to Heaven.</p>
                     <p>And with what Face can that Man object that the Torments of Hell are too great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, who, as terrible as they are, lives ſtill ſecure and undiſturb'd in his Sins? If they are ſo great that he complains of them, as unjuſt, Why doth he not leave his Sins? If he doth not forſake his Sins, they are not too great, ſince they have not attained that End upon him, for which the Puniſhment is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, <hi>viz.</hi> his Repentance and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Life! But if he doth not believe their Eternity, and therefore continues in his Sins, this ſhews, how neceſſary the Denouncing, and how neceſſary the Belief of eternal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments is. <hi>Out of thine own Mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked Servant: Thou kneweſt that I was an auſtere Man,</hi> wherefore then didſt thou not do as thou waſt commanded?</p>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Rewards and Puniſhments. We find by ſad Experience, how little offect the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:61773:476"/>now threatned have upon too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men, and if they were leſs dreadful they would be ſo much the leſs regarded. So that it appears, that the appointment of eternal Puniſhments was but neceſſary to keep Men from Sin, and what God's Wiſdom ſaw neceſſary to appoint, his Juſtice and Truth will make it neceſſary for him to inflict: For what he has ſo often and ſo ſolemnly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he can never depart from, but will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly execute it. The Promiſes and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings relating this Life are conditional, and are expreſly declared to be ſo, <hi>Jer.</hi> xviii. 7, 8, 9, 10. becauſe in this Life Men are change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able from Good to Bad, or from Bad to Good; but the Threatnings as well as the Promiſes concerning the other Life muſt be abſolute and unconditional, becauſe they relate to an unchangeable ſinal State, which will admit of no alteration either in the Wicked or the Righteous. It is not therefore becauſe God can recede from his Threatnings rather than from his Promiſes; that <hi>Nineveh</hi> was ſpared, but becauſe all Threatnings belonging to the State of this Life imply a condition of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, upon which they are not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, as <hi>Jonah</hi> and the <hi>Ninevites</hi> themſelves well underſtood: but then all Promiſes too, which concern this Life are under the like condition, and are not to be performed upon the Diſobedience of thoſe, to whom they are made, as we are aſſured by God's expreſs Declaration. But
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:61773:477"/>what is threatned or promiſed to Men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall them after this Life, is promiſed or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to befall them, when they ſhall be in a fixt unalterable State, and therefore muſt be uncapable of any Condition or Reſerve to be implied in it. For when Men continue the ſame they were at the time when God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Threatnings were declared to them, his Promiſes and Threatnings always take place in this World according to the full extent and importance of the Words in which they were delivered; and therefore they muſt thus take place in the next World, into which, when Men are once entred, they muſt for ever continue equally fit Objects either of the Divine Promiſes or Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, as they were at the time of their Death. The Point is, that God never changes, but Men are changeable in this Life; and both his Promiſes and Threatnings, which concern Men here, ſuppoſe them ſuch, and therefore <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> are with-held, or Puniſhments remitted in this World, as Men fall into Wickedneſs, or become reclaim'd from it. But in the other World, where the State of Men is unalterable from good or bad, vertuous or vicious, both the Promiſes and Threatnings of God muſt be punctually fulfilled, and can admit of no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or Reſervation. God has ſworn that thoſe, who will not believe and obey him, ſhall <hi>not enter into his Reſt.</hi> Heb. iii. 1i. and what he has once ſworn is irrevocable. <hi>Heb.</hi>
                        <pb n="359" facs="tcp:61773:477"/>vi. 17. <hi>If we believe not, yet be abideth faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, he cannot deny himſelf.</hi> 2 Tim. ii. 13. And it is not only <hi>threatned</hi> that the Wicked ſhall ſuffer eternal Puniſhment, but it is likewiſe expreſly <hi>foretold,</hi> that the wicked ſhall be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to <hi>everlaſting fire</hi> at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that they <hi>ſhall go away into everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Puniſhment.</hi> Matth. xxv. 41, 46. To leave no room for hopes of any End or Abatement of the Puniſhment, we have our Saviour's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Declaration, that the Sentence ſhall be paſt according to the Threatning, and that the everlaſting Puniſhment which is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſhall be certainly executed upon the wicked. Our Judge has beforehand declar'd, what Sentence he will paſs, the Terms where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are therefore as unalterable, as if it were already pronounc'd. He has declared that the Puniſhments of the wicked, as well as the Rewards of the righteous ſhall be eternal, as directly and poſſitively as he has ſaid any thing elſe relating to the laſt Judgment, or concerning any other part of his Goſpel, and we have as little reaſon to imagine that his expreſs and repeated Affirmation is capable of a reſerved Meaning in this particular, as in any other matter whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>Some of the Benefits and Advantages which are conſequent to the Puniſhments of this World are precedent to thoſe of the next: Here Men are puniſhed for their own Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or for the Advantage and Security of
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:61773:478"/>others or for both: In the next World the actual inflicting of Puniſhments is not for theſe ends, but they were threatned for theſe, and they muſt be inflicted when they have been once threatned and declared by God, who cannot lye. It is for the Repentance of Sinners, and for the Benefit of Good Men in preſerving them in the ways of Vertue, and ſecuring them from the Pride and Malice of the Wicked that Hell ſhould be threatned; but becauſe it is the final and eternal State of the Wicked, it cannot be for their Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after the Execution of its Torments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and Good Men being once out of the Power of Temptations, and placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Malice of the Wicked, can no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger have any Protection or Advantage from the Puniſhments dehounced againſt impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinners; but whether the Advantages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from Puniſhments be before or after the inflicting of Puniſhments, there is the ſame neceſſity for the appointing, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently for the inflicting them, <hi>viz.</hi> The Good of Mankind in keeping Men from Sin, and leaving thoſe without excuſe who will not be reſtrained from it, and work out their own Salvation. But another end of Puniſhment is, that Satisfaction for the violation of the Laws may be made to the ſupreme Authority which is deſpiſed and affronted by it: And the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of God's Honour and Authority, and of his Truth and Holineſs in his Hatred and
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:61773:478"/>Deteſtation of Sin, and his indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sinners, is manifeſted by the actual Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of the Damned, and it would be an Argument of the contrary to all this, if they were threatned and not inflicted.</p>
                     <p>And the Number of Perſons to be thus Puniſhed doth not alter the Caſe, but only ſhews that many are concerned in it; and if the caſe be the ſame, the Juſtice muſt be the ſame too, tho' the Perſons be never ſo many upon whom it is executed. That which is Juſt towards one, or Merciful towards one, is Juſt or Merciful towards never ſo many Thouſands. For Juſtice and Mercy conſiſt in the Nature of things, not in the greater or leſſer Number of Perſons to whom they are extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And tho' Multitudes of Criminals are apt to move compaſſion in Men; yet this proceeds partly from the Sympathy and Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Human Nature, which is mightily ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Number and Multitude to do either Good or Evil; partly from the Nature of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Affairs: For to deſtroy Multitudes would depopulate Cities and Countries, and would be an Affliction to Multitudes of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Perſons, their Friends and Relations. But it is not ſo in the preſent Caſe; there will be no want of Numbers in Heaven, and the Righteous ſhall be Everlaſtingly happy, and ſhall perceive no diminution of their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by reaſon of the Damnation of ſuch as were never ſo dear to them in this World.
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:61773:479"/>And Mercy and Pity is not a Paſſion in God as it is in Men, but a Perfection, it is the highſteſt Reaſon and Equity; and therefore tho' the Miſery of Sinners be never ſo ſevere, and the number of the Miſerable never ſo great; yet when the Equity and reaſonableneſs of the caſe doth not require it, there is nothing to move God for their Relief, becauſe he acts by the ſtanding Rules of Reaſon and Wiſdom, not by any Fondneſs and Weakneſs of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I come now to ſhew the Mercy of God in his inflicting Eternal Torments upon Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Strict Juſtice has a ſevere Aſpect, and it may ſeem hard for frail Man to abide the Sentence, that he may in ſtrictneſs of Juſtice deſerve. But from the Juſtice of God it is natural for us to appeal to his Mercy, and thither he allows us to appeal, but not ſo, as to expect that he ſhould be ſo merciful as not to be juſt, or ſhould forget that he is the Supreme Governour of the World, whilſt he extends his Mercy to the Offending and Criminal part of it. Puniſhment is neceſſary to all Government, and God as Governour of the World muſt inflict Puniſhments, and what theſe are to be, it belongs to his Sovereign Wiſdom to appoint.</p>
                     <p>And Eternal Torments were appointed for the Puniſhment of Sin, not only out of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry juſt, but even out of a gracious Deſign, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nothing leſs than the Threatnings of them
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:61773:479"/>would keep Men from Sin, and from that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery which is the unavoidable conſequence of it, and ſo bring them to Heaven. It is an Antient and true Obſervation which

God <hi>hath no pleaſure in the Death of the Wicked: but that the wicked turn from his way and live,</hi> as he ſolemnly and with an Oath declares by his Prophet, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> xxxiii. 11. It is His principal Intention and Deſire, that all Men ſhould be ſaved: He has proclaimed Himſelf to be <hi>the Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth, keeping Mercy for Thouſands, forgiving Iniquity, and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and Sin;</hi> but then it is added, that he <hi>will by no means clear the guilty,</hi> that is, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and impenitent Sinner. <hi>Exod.</hi> xxxiv. 6, 7. He exhorts, he invites, he promiſes, he threatens; he promiſes eternal Happineſs, and threatens eternal Miſery, to give all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to Vice, and all the Enducement to Religion and Vertue which is poſſible. Laſt of all, he has ſent his Son to inſtruct us in our Duty, and to confirm all this to us, and to purchaſe our Redemption with his own Blood.</p>
                     <p>God deals with Men in the plaineſt and moſt condeſcending manner, He lays their Duty before them with the Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments annex'd, and both eternal, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſecure them in their Obedience, and force them to be happy: and then he takes Men at no Advantage, but makes all reaſonable Allowances, in conſideration of the frailty of Humane Nature, and in condeſcenſion to their
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:61773:481"/>Infirmities; He exacts not abſolute Perfection, nor any impoſſible Obedience, but requires, that, tho' we cannot live without Sin, yet we ſhould not ſin wilfully and obſtinately; that we ſhould not allow and indulge our ſelves in Sin, and ſhould repent if we have done ſo; He requires a faithful and ſincere Diligence in all the Parts of our Duty, which is no more than what every Father and Maſter expects from his Children and Servants: When Men have ſinned, God admits of their Repentance, and if after Repentance they ſin again, yet ſtill they ſhall be accepted upon a renew'd Repentance: nay, after a long courſe of Sin, a ſincere Repentance may reconcile them to God, and no Repentance can be too late, that is ſincere. It is extreamly dangerous indeed to defer our Repentance for one Moment, becauſe our Lives are ſo uncertain, and we may provoke God to that degree, that he will no longer afford us an Opportunity to repent, nor beſtow that Grace upon us, which is neceſſary to Repentance. But this is after repeated Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, and an obſtinate rejecting of the Goodneſs of God, which leads Men to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: And theſe are the Terms of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that <hi>when the wicked Man turneth away from his Wickedneſs that he hath committed, and doth that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſave his Soul alive.</hi> There is Great <hi>Joy in Heaven over one Sinner that repenteth,</hi> and the return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prodigal is received with the greateſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:61773:482"/>and Tenderneſs. If we will be obedient, we have the Aſſiſtance of God's Grace, and if we have done amiſs, yet His grace is offered us to bring us to Repentance, and we may be pardoned upon ſincere Reſolutions of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience for the future. But if Men either diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe or diſregard all theſe things, if they neither care for God's Promiſes, nor fear his Threatnings; if they trample under foot the Blood of his Son, and grieve his bleſſed Spirit; if all the Methods of his Mercy and Goodneſs be loſt upon them, there remains no other Remedy, but Juſtice muſt have its courſe. If when they are told ſo long beforehand, what danger they are in, Men will continue obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in their Diſobedience, after ſo many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations and Encouragements to Repentance, and after ſo great Importunity and Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; they can have no reaſon to complain of the Severity of that Sentence, which they have been ſo often threatned with, and have as often deſpiſed.</p>
                     <p>Since the Rewards are eternal on the one hand, and the Puniſhments on the other, the Rewards being proportionable to the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Terms are on both ſides equal; and ſince it is in our Power by the Help of the Divine Grace to avoid the Puniſhments and obtain the Rewards, the Condition is ſuch, as that any wiſe Man would be thankful for it, and would be glad that ſuch a Prizee is put into his hands; ſo far would he be from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:61773:482"/>that the Terrors of Puniſhments are join'd to the Encouragement of Rewards; that all Motives concur to make him happy, and that God has uſed all means both inward by his Grace, and outward by his Promiſes and Threatnings to bring us to Salvation.</p>
                     <p>I repeat it again, for God himſelf often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats it in the Holy Scriptures; God <hi>hath no Pleaſure in the Death of the Wicked,</hi> but hath uſed all means to prevent it, he hath provided Heaven for us, and threatned Hell, if we will not be perſwaded to go to Heaven. If Men will neglect the Means of their Salvation, and will not repent and turn to him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his moſt loving and compaſſionate Exhortations, and the Death of his own Son for them, if neither Heaven can invite, nor Hell frighten them from their Sins, they muſt thank themſelves only for that Deſtruction, which they bring upon themſelves. The Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal which God ſo long ago made to the <hi>Houſe of Iſrael,</hi> may at the laſt Day be alledg'd to Sinners. Ye have ſaid, that <hi>the way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now,</hi> O ye Sinners, <hi>Is not my way equal,</hi> have not <hi>your ways</hi> been <hi>unequal?</hi> And the ways of God ſhall then appear ſo equal, and the ways of wicked Men ſo unreaſonable and perverſe, that their own Conſciences ſhall bear Witneſs againſt them; and He that died to ſave them will pronounce the Sentence of eternal Damnation upon them.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THere is nothing which vulgar Minds are more ſurpriſed and offended at, nor at which Men of Underſtanding and Experience are leſs enclin'd to wonder or take Offence, than the ſeveral Laws and Cuſtoms of divers Nations in the different Ages and Climates of the World: The Habit, the Language, the Letters, and manner of Writing; the Food, the Complexion, the Features of the Body, and Diſpoſition of the Mind are various in different Countries and Ages. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore it is no wonder that the Political and Ceremonial Part of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law, which was given ſo many Ages ago, and in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which is at this Day very different in its Cuſtoms from ours, ſhould be as different from the Cuſtoms in uſe amongſt us, as the Age and Climate. For when God doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Laws for Men, he muſt be ſuppoſed to appoint ſuch as are ſuitable to the Neceſſities and Occaſions of thoſe for whom they are made. And ſome who have travelled into the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:61773:483"/>Eaſtern Countries, which are not ſo variable in their Faſhions and Way of Living, as the Weſtern Nations are, have found great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages both from the Nature of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and of the Climates, and from the Cuſtoms and Manners of thoſe Parts of the World, for the explication of divers places of Scripture, which depend upon the knowledge of thoſe Countries.</p>
                     <p>Now the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law may be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the <hi>Moral,</hi> the <hi>Political</hi> or <hi>Judicial,</hi> and the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law. The Moral Part of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, which is contain'd in the Ten Commandments, and enjoyns our Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and towards our Neighbour, is juſt and holy beyond all Controverſy or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. And the Political or Judicial Part with the Ceremonial was adapted to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and Neceſſities of thoſe Ages and that Nation. And if the Moral Part be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely moſt Divine and Holy, and the Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Inſtitutions both Political and Ritual, were the moſt fit and proper for that Time and Government; that is, if they were the beſt that could be, for thoſe Ages and that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; then the whole Body of the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law is without all juſt Exception. And that this is ſo, it will be evident, if we obſerve the Reaſons upon which the Poſitive Laws amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> were inſtituted.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Judicial Laws, relating to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Juſtice in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:61773:484"/>are ſo reaſonable, that they have been tranſcrib'd into the Laws of the wiſeſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Nations, as hath been particularly ſhewn by Learned Men. There are but few of the Judicial Laws which have been objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and theſe have been often and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vindicated. The Law which ſeems moſt harſh and rigorous is that of Retaliation; which yet was the moſt antient way of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in moſt Nations, and was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt for the Laws to inflict, tho' it was ſinful in the Perſons injured to require it out of a Deſire of Revenge, and with a Delight to gratify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Enemies Sufferings. For if it be juſt to puniſh the taking away of a little Money with Death, how can it be unjuſt to inflict the ſame Puniſhment for the depriving a Man of his Eye? And if it be not unjuſt to make Death the Puniſhment of ſtriking out an Eye (and what Nation doth not puniſh much leſs Injuries with Death?) How can it be unjuſt to puniſh the Offender with the Loſs of his own Eye? One of the ſevereſt Laws that ever was known amongſt a civiliſed People, was that of the Twelve Tables, which gave leave to

Frequent Waſhings likewiſe are requiſite in hot Countries for Health and Refreſhment; Religion preſcrib'd only the Time, and Manner, and particular Occaſion of it, the Thing it ſelf is Natural. And when we ſee ſuch a Body of Laws of ſo great Antiquity, well contriv'd and wiſely inſtituted for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them; if there be in ſome of them any thing peculiar and ſingular; tho' they were but the Laws of a Man, yet common Modeſty and Candor might make us conclude, that ſo wiſe a Lawgiver muſt have ſome good Reaſon for thoſe particular Laws, which at
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:61773:485"/>this diſtance of Time and Place cannot be ſo obvious to us; but it would be Raſhneſs to ſuſpect that he had no ſufficient Reaſon for thoſe, who appears to have enacted the reſt with ſo great Wiſdom. Thus it would be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for a Man of tolerable Modeſty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, even concerning a Syſtem of Humane Laws, tho' no probable Account could be given of many of them. But when God is the Lawgiver, this ought to ſilence all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, that they are his Laws, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be wiſe and good for that People, at that Time, and in their Condition and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. The Will and Authority of God, without any other Reaſon, is ſufficient of it ſelf, in any Caſe to be alledg'd, and it may be fit in ſome Caſes, that we ſhould have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reaſon to produce.</p>
                     <p>It is a raſh and dangerous thing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that God did not command this or that, becauſe we do not ſee why it ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; this is to ſay, that we will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve God to be the Author of any thing which we do not like, or would not have to be His. Are we wont to argue thus about Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws? Would it be any Excuſe for a diſobedient Subject to ſay, that in his Opinion, ſuch Laws were not fit to be made, and that therefore he would not believe his Prince had made ſuch Laws; when he had all due notice and full evidence, that he had appointed them, but was reſolved to reject the whole
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:61773:485"/>Body of Laws upon the account of ſome which he did not fancy, which yet were obſolete and out of Date? Do we not allow that Reaſons of State and of Government may require ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things to be done, and many Laws to be made, which it doth not belong to private Men to be curious about, and which the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Part of the Subjects are not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend? And are not God's Thoughts infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely above the Thoughts of the wiſeſt Men, and infinitely farther out of our Reach, than the Counſels of the moſt Prudent and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Prince can be above the Underſtanding of his meaneſt and moſt ignorant Subjects? How ſhall we dare then to reject any Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, becauſe it is not agreeable in every particular to our Thoughts and Notions of things? But I ſhall enquire however into the Reaſons and Grounds, which appear to us at this diſtance of Time for the Ceremonial Laws, and I doubt not but theſe will be ſufficient to juſtify them to all impartial Men.</p>

Thus the Death of Chriſt was typified or reſembled, or repreſented and prefigured by the Death of the Beaſts which were Sacrificed; they were ſigns appointed to keep up the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance that Chriſt was to be Sacrificed, and were very apt and proper to put Men in Mind of it. It was acknowledged by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and received from the Beginning as a certain Rule for the Interpretation of Scripture that there was a Typical as well as a Literal Senſe of it, relating to the <hi>Meſſias</hi> and his Kingdom. Circumciſion was to ſignify to them that Chriſt was to be born of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom Circumciſion was firſt enjoyned upon the Promiſe made to him of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> from whom Chriſt was to deſcend: And the Blood ſhed in Circumciſion was Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal of that Blood which Chriſt was to ſhed for us.</p>
                     <p>The moſt probable Account of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Sacrifices is, that they were at firſt of Divine Inſtitution, and were appointed ſoon after the Fall of Man as Types of the Sacrifice of the Death of Chriſt, who was promiſed to be ſent to die for the Expiation of Sin.

                     <p>A future State was always believ'd by the <hi>Jews,</hi> as revealed to them in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and whatever Texts there may be, which ſeem to imply the contrary, they are either ſpoken only by way of Objection, as in the Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> or elſe they have no Relation to the State after this Life, either to affirm or deny it; but are to be underſtood to proceed from that Deſire, which pious Men had to honour and glorify God in their ſeveral Generations, by reſtoring his Worſhip, where it had been neglected, or in propagating his Religion, where it had not been yet known. Thus that good King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> ſays to God in his Thankſgiving; <hi>The Grave cannot praiſe thee, Death cannot celebrate thee: they that go down into the Pit, cannot hope for thy Truth.

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:61773:494"/>of a Future State both of Body and Soul.</p>
                     <p>The Doctrin deliverd by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets was as effectual a Caution and warning to Men, to keep them from <hi>the place of Torments</hi> as a Meſſage from the Dead could have been, <hi>Luke</hi> xvi. 31. The Old Teſtament therefore is not deficient in any neceſſary Point of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but the Ceremonial Law was enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as a ſuitable Help and Expedient for the retaining thoſe Truths which had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed before. Which was ſo well known,
<note n="(x)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Origen. contra. Celſ. lib.</hi> 2,</note> that <hi>Celſus</hi> puts this as an Objection into the Mouth of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom he brings in Arguing againſt the Chriſtian Religion, that it taught them nothing but what they knew before, concerning the Reſurrection of the Dead, and a future Judgment and a State of Rewards and Puniſhments in another World. And it cannot be denied that the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> as well as the <hi>Canonical</hi> 'Books teach theſe things.</p>
                     <p>The Honour and Authority of our Religion amongſt Men depends very much upon a right Knowledge and a due conſideration of this Subject. And thoſe who profeſs never ſo great Veneration for the New Teſtament, but have little eſteem for any part of the Old, underſtand neither the one nor the other as they ought. They refer all along to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and muſt ſtand or fall together, for the one is but a Draught as it were, or Model
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:61773:494"/>of the other; all things being though ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, yet ſufficiently taught in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, which are fully and lively expreſt in the New.</p>
                     <p>The Sum of all is this. The Faith in the <hi>Meſſias</hi> to come, and the Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Morality had been delivered down from the Beginning by <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> to their Poſterity: And when <hi>Moſes</hi> by God's Direction and Appointment gave Laws to the Children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the End and Deſign of theſe Laws was the preſervation of this Faith and Practice amongſt them. And this was effected by viſible Objects and ſenſible Remembrances; the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſation was ordain'd in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion to the Circumſtances and Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of thoſe Ages and that Nation, in ſuch a manner as was moſt ſuitable to their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and moſt Worthy of God; the reſt of the World had wholly given up and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned themſelves to Carnal Ordinances and Superſtitions; and God, who produceth Good out of Evil, made uſe of this Fondneſs and Dotage of Mankind to the Preſervation and Advancement of Truth and Holineſs amongſt Men. The Ceremonial Worſhip was no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acceptable to God, and no otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd by Him, than to keep his People from running into Idolatry, to which they had ſo great a Proneneſs, to put them in mind of their own Sinfulneſs and Unworthineſs, to preſerve a Senſe of Moral Duties, and of an
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:61773:495"/>inward and ſpiritual Service; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Remembrance and Expectation of that <hi>Sacrifice, Oblation and Satisfaction,</hi> which had been foretold, and was <hi>in the Fulneſs of time</hi> to be offered upon the Croſs for the Sins of the World.</p>
                     <p>Thanks be to God, that we are inſtructed to worſhip him <hi>in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo many burthenſome Ceremonies; but in thoſe Ages of the World, nothing would have ſeem'd more ſtrange and abſurd than a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without ſome Pomp and Solemnity of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies: And God appointed for his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thoſe which were innocent, to reſtrain them from all that were wicked and hurtful; He appointed the Sacrifices of Beaſts to be Types of Chriſt's Sacrifice, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them from Humane Sacrifices, which were practiſed in other Nations, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd by other Religions; he commanded them to abſtain from certain Meats, that they might not eat of Things offer'd to Idols, and theſe innocent Ceremonies he made uſeful and ſerviceable to the Great Ends of Faith and Righteouſneſs. Nothing impracticable can be ſuppoſed to be preſcrib'd by God to any People; nothing which is above their Abilities and preſent Attainments; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would be of no uſe and benefit to them. But rather the Divine Goodneſs would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to their Infirmities, and comply with them in giving them ſuch Laws, as may be
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:61773:495"/>agreeable and convenient for them in their preſent State, and may fit them for an higher and more excellent Diſpenſation. Whatſoever we may think of it now, nothing at the time, when the Law was given, would have look'd like Religion, that had been without abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Rites and Ceremonies. And herein the Wiſdom of God appears, that to ſuch a People and in ſuch an Age, he gave a Law ſo admirably proper, and well contriv'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Life and Subſtance of Religion under the Veil of Ceremonies, and to prepare them for the coming of his Son, when it was to be of no longer continuance. <hi>The Law was given by Moſes, but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Joh. i. 17. that is, the Grace of the Goſpel, and the Truth and Reality or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of thoſe Things, which were prefigur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Law.</p>

                        <hi>Rabbins</hi> ſtill teach that the Gift of Prophecy is to return at the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> according to God's expreſs Promiſe: And the <hi>Samaritans</hi> themſelves had this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that he was to give full Inſtructions in all things relating to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. <hi>Joh.</hi> iv. 25. And the Prophecies concerning the Birth, and Life, and Death of Chriſt, in all things neceſſary to prove him the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> were litterally fulfilled in our Saviour, and thoſe things which concern the Nature of His Kingdom, have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd by Him and his Apoſtles. So that it being fully prov'd, that Jeſus is the Chriſt by the Accompliſhment in Him of the Antient Prophecies concerning the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> we ought to reſt ſatisfied in his Authority, both for the Ceſſation of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and for any Explication which He and his Apoſtles have given us of it. But this is not all, we are able to prove againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> from the Books of the Old Teſtament, that their Laws was to ceaſe, when the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was come.</p>
                     <pb n="331" facs="tcp:61773:496"/>
                     <p>The Goſpel is ſo far from containing any thing contrary to the Law, that it is the Fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Accompliſhment of it. The Moral Precepts are improv'd and advanced, and the Ceremonial and Ritual Part was not properly abrogated and aboliſh'd, but it continued for as long time as it was deſign'd to do, and then expir'd of it ſelf; it ſerv'd theſe Ends for which it was inſtituted, and afterwards muſt of conſequence ceaſe. The Ceremonial Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip therefore was permitted to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who became Converts to the Chriſtian Faith, till the Deſtruction of their City and Temple, and then it was no longer practicable, but muſt of neceſſity ceaſe; and the Ceſſation of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when once it had its Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod and Accompliſhment, was as much the Will of the Legiſlator, at its firſt Inſtitution, as its former Obligation could be.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law being Figurative and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical, it follows, that it was to ceaſe of courſe, when the Things prefigur'd and typified by it, ſhould be brought to paſs, that is, when the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould come. For then the Types and Figures being fulfilled, could be of no longer uſe, nor the Law which enjoyn'd them, of any longer continuance, when once this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Reaſon of it ceaſed, and all other ends deſign'd by it, might be better attain'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, by the Worſhip of God <hi>in Spirit and in Truth.</hi> And this Law was ſo contriv'd, as not only to expire upon the fulfilling of it
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:61773:497"/>by the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> but to become impracticable and impoſſible to be obſerv'd afterwards. I ſhall therefore prove the Ceſſation of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Law. I. Becauſe the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is come, in whom it was fulfilled. II. Becauſe it was foretold by the Prophets, that the Law ſhould ceaſe upon the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> III.

                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is come, in whom the Law is fulfilled.

The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Government all along under all Changes was ſtill denominated from <hi>Judah,</hi> tho' that Tribe was not always in Chief Power; and even under <hi>Herod,</hi> who was an <hi>Idumean,</hi> it had its Title from <hi>Judah;</hi> as the Roman Empire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd its old Denomination, when divers of the Emperours were not <hi>Romans</hi> by Birth.
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:61773:500"/>But when the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was come, the Sceptre was to depart from <hi>Judah,</hi> and there were no more to be any Law in force amongſt that People, who had been ſo long known under that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, which they receiv'd from him. And this Prophecy of <hi>Jacob,</hi> in which he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels the Condition of the ſeveral Tribes, has a plain Reference to the Promiſed Land, and is to be underſtood of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Government in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> for he there deſcribes the Borders of it.

But when the time of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Prophecy was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd, and <hi>Shiloh</hi> was come, they were driven out, never to be reſtor'd again.

                        <hi>Jews,</hi> who yet had to do with one of the moſt merciful Princes, that ſtands upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in Hiſtory. If <hi>Tiberius,</hi> or <hi>Caligula,</hi> or <hi>Nero</hi> had deſtroyed them, it might have been aſcrib'd to the Cruelty of their Temper; but when <hi>Titus,</hi> who endeavour'd to ſave them, was by their own Obſtinacy forc'd upon their Deſtruction, after they had by their Diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made themſelves a Prey to him, there was the viſible Hand of God in it; as <hi>Joſephus</hi> often confeſſes, and as <hi>Titus</hi> himſelf declar'd, when he beheld the Towers and Fortifications, after the City was taken. If they could have agreed either in their own Defence, or in any Terms of Submiſſion to him, they would have been far from ſuffering in that Extremity. When <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Craſſus</hi> entred <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the time of its Deſtruction was not yet come, but it was reſerv'd to <hi>Titus,</hi> whoſe peculiar Character it was, that he oblig'd all Men, and who was ſtil'd the <hi>Love and Delight of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> unwillingly to do that, which neither <hi>Pompey</hi> nor <hi>Craſſus</hi> would do.

And in that Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity they had Prophets to direct and ſupport them under their affliction, and give them aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of a Reſtoration, but now they do not ſo much as pretend to have any.

And in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, God declares that when at any time for their Sins they were led into Captivity, and diſperſed among the Heathens, tho' they were driven unto the utmoſt part of Heaven, yet upon their Repentance he would <hi>turn their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and have compaſſion upon them, and would return and gather them from all the Nations, whither he had ſcattered them,</hi> Deut. xxx. 2, 3.

The time for the duration of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment being expired, all promiſes made to them as a diſtinct People and Nation, muſt be expired with it; whereas if their Law were ſtill in force, the promiſe of their being reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their Land and Government would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:61773:503"/>before this time have been fulfilled to them. For, beſides that their Sins at their return from their Captivity in <hi>Babylon</hi> were very great, it cannot be ſuppoſed, that for ſo many Ages their Sins ſhould hinder that a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant at leaſt ſhould not be reſtored, if the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Oeconomy had not received its final period in the deſtruction of their City and Nation.

                     <p>If againſt all this it be alledged, That the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law was to endure <hi>for ever,</hi> it ought to be conſidered what ſenſe that expreſſion bears in the Law it ſelf.

                     <head>CHAP. XVII. <hi>Of Sinful Examples Recorded in the Scriptures.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>AS ſome have endeavour'd to excuſe their own Sins by alledging the Sinful Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which we find mention'd in the Scriptures;
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:61773:505"/>ſo others, who are no leſs fond of imitating them, yet have from hence taken a pretence for Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections and Cavils. I ſhall therefore ſhew, that the bad Examples in ſome actions of Men whom we find in all other reſpects commended in the Scriptures, are far from being propoſed for our imitation; but there is great reaſon why the Faults and Miſcarriages of the beſt Men ſhould be deliver'd down to us in the Scriptures for our Caution and Prevention, as well as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other accounts.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Several paſſages of the Scriptures contain only Matter of Fact, and that very briefly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd; and a bare Narrative of any Action, implies neither the Approbation nor the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it, but only declares that ſuch a thing was done, and in ſuch a manner: but the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Fact it ſelf, with the Circumſtances of it, or ſome Command or Permiſſion, or Prohibition in Scripture, muſt diſcover the goodneſs or lawfulneſs, or the wickedneſs of the Action. No Hiſtorian is ſuppoſed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of all which he relates; but he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port bad as well as good Deeds, who will do the part of a faithful Hiſtorian.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The Rules of Good and Evil are plainly delivered in the Scriptures, by which we are to judge of Actions; and we are to conform our Actions not to the Example of Men, but to the Law of God. We are forewarn'd to follow no Man's Example, when it is contrary to the Divine Law; and therefore it could not be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:61773:506"/>in the relating of every evil Action to ſet a mark of Infamy upon it, and a Caution againſt the imitation of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The Relation of the bad Actions of Good Men may be of great uſe and benefit, tho' we are not to follow, but avoid them; Becauſe,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This ſhews the ſincerity of the Pen-Men of the Scriptures, that they ſpare no perſon whatſoever, but relate the plain Matter of Fact, even tho' themſelves be concern'd, when it is never ſo much to their diſgrace; as in the Denial of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and other inſtances.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By this we learn the Frailty of Humane Nature, and the neceſſary dependance that the beſt Men muſt have upon God for his Grace in the performing any good Action; <hi>Every good Gift, and every perfect Gift is from above,</hi> Jam. i. 17.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We learn from hence, that God can bring Good out of Evil, and doth often over-rule even the worſt Actions to the accompliſhment of the beſt Ends, and <hi>putteth no Truſt in his Saints,</hi> Job xv. 15.</p>
                     <p>There is a Remarkable Inſtance to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the Caſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> when <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> came by fraud and ſubtilty and depriv'd his Brother of the Bleſſing.
<note n="(p)" place="margin">Caſaub. <hi>in</hi> Athenae. <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. c. 11.</note> It was in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times cuſtomary to offer that of which they were to eat, in Sacrifice, eſpecially on ſo Solemn an Occaſion, as a Father's giving his final Bleſſing; and as in this Caſe, foretelling
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:61773:506"/>the Fate of his Poſterity: And therefore when <hi>Jacob</hi> had by ſubtilty got the Bleſſing of his Father, <hi>Iſaac</hi> could not recall it to conferr it upon <hi>Eſau,</hi> becauſe what was done in ſo ſolemn a manner had a Religious Obligation amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of an Oath; and Oaths tho' ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by fraud were Obligatory, as we learn from the Caſe of the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> he had <hi>bleſſed Jacob before the Lord;</hi> and the Prediction that <hi>the Elder ſhould ſerve the Younger,</hi> Gen. xxv. 23. with <hi>Eſau</hi>'s deſpiſing and ſelling his Birth-right might now probably come into <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Mind; whereupon, tho' he did not approve of the fraud by which the Bleſſing was obtain'd, yet he knew it to be irrevocable, and that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Purpoſe and Prediction would be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd thereby; and what he had by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Spirit conferr'd, it was not in his power to recall. The Relation therefore of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth not juſtifie <hi>Jacob</hi>'s behaviour in it, but manifeſts the over-ruling Providence of God, to make any Means whatſoever inſtrumental to his gracious Ends, which can never be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed by any Actions of Men: for if they depended upon humane Actions, theſe would often fail them; the beſt Men being ſubject to ſo much frailty and ſin.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Tho' God of his Mercy doth accept of the imperfect Services of the Righteous, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving upon their habitual Repentance the Sins and Frailties which are mix'd with the beſt Actions; and pardoning the worſt Actions
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:61773:507"/>likewiſe after a particular Repentance and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of Life: yet theſe ſtand upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord for the glory of God's grace in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Forgiveneſs, and for a memorial and warning to future Ages; that Men may neither preſume upon their own Righteouſneſs, nor deſpair of God's Mercy. But becauſe they are pardon'd, they are not always cenſur'd. And I think the ill Actions of Good Men are ſeldom or never mention'd with a mark of God's diſpleaſure, unleſs the Series of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory require it; and then the reproof is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, which paſs'd at the time of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of them; as in the Caſe of <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter.</hi> But where no ſuch Cenſure was paſs'd at the time of the Action, the Action it ſelf is barely related, and nothing further ſaid of it; becauſe the Crime being forgiven, God forbears to ſhew any further diſpleaſure againſt it; ſuch is his Mercy to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting Sinners. And there could be no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, as I have obſerv'd, for any Cenſure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of others, who may know by the plain Rule of God's word what Actions are ſinful, tho' they are not always ſtyl'd ſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Commiſſion of them.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XVIII. <hi>Of the Imprecations in the</hi> Pſalms, <hi>and other Books of the Old Teſtament.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>ONE of the greateſt Excellencies of the Chriſtian Religion is the Univerſal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which it enjoyns; and we ſhall find that Charity was likewiſe the Doctrine of the Old Teſtament, and that there is nothing in the Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> or any other part of the Old Teſtament, contrary to this Doctrine; which will appear, if we conſider the peculiar Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for thoſe expreſſions, which may ſeem to imply any thing contrary to it.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Many of thoſe Expreſſions are uſed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Nations, upon whom after ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Acts of Mercy and Forbearance on his part, and repeated provocations on theirs, God had commanded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to execute his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and the Sins of the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were the cauſe that this was not accompliſh'd: and therefore it was lawfull for them to pray that they might have grace to repent, and that their Sins might be no hindrance to them in the fulfilling his will; but that God would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them <hi>to execute vengeance upon the Heathen, Pſ.</hi> cxlix. 7. And it was lawful likewiſe to pray againſt all the other Enemies of God, that he would abaſe their Pride, and make them
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:61773:508"/>
                        <hi>to know themſelves to be but Men,</hi> Pſ. ix. 20. lxxiv. 22, 23. cxxxix. 21, 22.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>David</hi> being King, had the Sword of Juſtice committed to him, he was <hi>the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that did evil;</hi> and therefore when his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Subjects were too ſtrong for him, as in the Rebellion of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> he might make his Appeal to God, and beſeech him to take the matter into his own hand. If he might puniſh his Subjects, he might pray to God that he would enable him to do it. And in Foreign Wars, if he might kill his Enemies, he might pray for Victory and Succeſs over them.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. It is lawful to pray that publick and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Malefactors may be puniſh'd, for it is lawful to diſcover them, and bring them to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; and it muſt needs be lawful to pray that that may be done, which it is lawful for us to do. It is lawful to ſeek redreſs of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Injuries, and therefore it is lawful to pray that they may be redreſs'd; for we may pray for ſucceſs upon any honeſt undertaking. If this be done out of a love to Juſtice, and a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary care of our own preſervation; not out of malice, and a thirſt after Revenge, but with the moſt favourable conſtruction that the worſt Actions are capable of, and with hearty Prayers to God for his Bleſſing upon the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender; in giving him the grace of Repentance, and granting him whatſoever happineſs in this
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:61773:508"/>World may be conſiſtent with the honour of God, and Juſtice towards other Men, and the Salvation of his own Soul.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. God was the peculiar Law-giver, and Political Governour of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rewards and Puniſhments were the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Laws which he had given them. For the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law is called <hi>the miniſtration of Death,</hi> and <hi>the Miniſtration of Condemnation,</hi> 2 Cor. iii. 7, 9. becauſe the promiſes of the Law, as <hi>ſuch,</hi> belong'd only to this Life, and a Curſe was denounc'd againſt <hi>every one, that continu'd not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. iii. 10, 11. God had expreſly threatned to inflict Puniſhment in this Life, for the tranſgreſſion of thoſe Laws; and therefore to pray to God that his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might overtake Evil doers, was no more than it is in other Governments, to proſecute Offenders before the Magiſtrate, they appealed to God to put his Laws in force againſt them, and not to ſuffer the wicked to go unpuniſh'd in contempt of thoſe Laws, which he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and under that diſpenſation which was eſtabliſh'd upon Temporal Rewards and Puniſhments. They were not allow'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge their anger and deſire of Revenge, yet they might pray that God would avenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his Enemies, and reſcue his Laws from that contempt which they muſt lie under from wicked Men, if they did not feel thoſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the Laws of God threatned them withall.</p>
                     <pb n="332" facs="tcp:61773:509"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                     <pb n="334" facs="tcp:61773:510"/>
                     <p>But under the Goſpel the Caſe is different; for now we are not to expect that Temporal Rewards and Puniſhments ſhould conſtantly follow upon the performance or tranſgreſſion of our Duty; but both of them may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reſerved to a future State. A Chriſtian may not pray for Judgments upon his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, becauſe God has not ſo peremptorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the Goſpel, that he will inflict his Puniſhments in this Life, as he had done by the Law, and we have our Saviour's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Example to pray for their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that they be not puniſhed in the next. But a Chriſtian may right himſelf in due courſe of Law; and in order to that, may Petition the Judge without any breach of Charity; and this was all that the <hi>Jews</hi> did, when they pray'd God to execute his own Laws, by inflicting ſuch Puniſhments as he had threatned to inflict upon the Tranſgreſſors of them in this Life: they invoked and appealed to God as their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Judge and Sovereign, and pray'd Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Offenders.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. Thoſe which ſeem Imprecations, are oftentimes Predictions or Denunciations of Judgments to come upon Sinners; as we may learn from <hi>Acts</hi> 1.20. And it can be no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs to foretell or denounce God's Judgments againſt Sinners, but rather an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Charity towards them for their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and Amendment.</p>
                     <pb n="335" facs="tcp:61773:510"/>
                     <p>Moſt of thoſe places of Scripture may as properly be rendred by way of prediction in the Future Tenſe; and when they cannot, they may be look'd upon as denunciations of God's Wrath. For Prophets were ſometimes em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to execute the Divine Judgments, as we ſee in <hi>Elijah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> i. 9, 10. and as they ſometimes executed God's Judgments, ſo they at other times denounced them; and this had nothing of uncharitableneſs in it, but is fully agreeable with the Goſpel it ſelf. For thus we read that <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> were puniſhed with preſent death by St. <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> v. But if St. <hi>Peter</hi> had denounced Death without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting it immediately upon them, this had been leſs. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> prays that the <hi>Lord would reward Alexander the Copper-Smith according to his works,</hi> who had <hi>done him much evil,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 14. which was no uncharitable imprecation, but a leaving him to God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a denunciation of puniſhment to befall him without Repentance; it was an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative Act, and in conſequence of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication which the Apoſtle had inflicted upon him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. And when God had inſpired and empower'd Men to denounce Judgments, this was no more againſt Charity, than the inflicting of them would have been, or than Excommunication it ſelf is. If Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are empower'd in the King's Name to give Sentence, and to inflict Puniſhments, certainly Men may be ſo empower'd and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriz'd
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:61773:511"/>by God himſelf, and may act or ſpeak accordingly, without breach of Charity.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. The Expreſſions <hi>Pſ.</hi> lxix. and cix. are to be underſtood concerning <hi>Judas,</hi> as we find them applied, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. and all other Expreſſions of the ſame nature may be underſtood either of him, or of ſome others like him, whom the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> by inſpiration might know to be hardned in Sin, paſt Repentance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might pray that God would rather cut them off, than ſuffer them to do more miſchief in this World, and increaſe the number of their Iniquities here, and of their Miſeries in the World to come.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. Laſtly, This Suppoſition is tacitly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in Imprecations, if they will perſiſt in their Sins, if they will not repent; and the Penmen of the Holy Scriptures might in ſome Caſes know by Revelation, that Judgments were the only means to reclaim thoſe Men againſt whom they pray'd, and then it was the greateſt Charity to pray that God would be pleaſed to make uſe of that Remedy, which alone was leſt for their Amendment; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or they are Prayers to God to aſſiſt them in the doing what both Juſtice and Charity will allow to be done, either by Perſons in Authority, as King <hi>David,</hi> or even by private Men; as in the proſecution of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, and bringing them to condign puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and this may be without any degree of Malice, or the leaſt breach of Charity; ſince Puniſhment it ſelf may be not only an act of Juſtice but of Charity likewiſe towards divers Men. Or theſe Expreſſions may be Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to God as the Political Governour and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator of the <hi>Jews:</hi> Or they are Predictions or Denunciations of God's wrath againſt Sinners.

                     <p>And tho' the <hi>Jews</hi> in latter Ages perverted ſome paſſages of their Law to ſerve their own Pride and Revenge; yet, as it is evident by many inſtances, never any Law but that of Chriſt oblig'd Men to more Humanity towards Strangers, or more Charity towards Enemies.

                     <head>CHAP. XIX. <hi>Of the Texts of the Old Teſtament cited in the New.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THO' the Apoſtles having prov'd their Divine Commiſſion by ſo many and ſo undeniable Miracles had an infallible Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to interpret and apply the Texts of the Old Teſtament in confirmation of the Goſpel; yet it is not to be doubted, but that the Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which ſeem to have moſt difficulty in them, are ſuch as that the <hi>Jews</hi> of that time, againſt whom they were urged, could not but acknowledge that the Apoſtles gave the true Expoſition of them, tho' they deny'd that they were truly apply'd to our Saviour, and his Goſpel. For unleſs the Apoſtles had either made out their Citations from the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Maximes and Principles then known and receiv'd among the <hi>Jews,</hi> or had alledg'd them in ſuch a ſenſe, as was then generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd, it had been to no purpoſe to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them at all againſt them.</p>
                     <p>It is known likewiſe and obſervable upon this occaſion, that after the Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> tho' the Bible was read in the Synagogues in the Original Hebrew, yet it was alſo Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the vulgar Language, and the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter did not always Tranſlate the Text ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim, but often gave the ſenſe of it in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent words, and with ſome latitude, to render
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:61773:513"/>it the more intelligible. This way of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation was at length improv'd into a <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe, containing with the Text a ſhort explication of it according to the ſenſe of the moſt Learned among the <hi>Jews,</hi> tho' there muſt be ſuppoſed to have been many Notions cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent among them, which would not be brought within the compaſs of that Expoſition. The Writers therefore of the New Teſtament might ſometimes give ſuch an Interpretation of the Texts of the Old Teſtament, as was as well, or better known among them for whom they wrote, than the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text was; or they might take upon themſelves the liberty of Interpreters, the better to explain the Texts alledged, and enforce their Arguments.</p>
                     <p>Thus for inſtance, St. <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> vii. would never have produc'd any thing out of the Old Teſtament before the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim;</hi> nor would St. <hi>Luke</hi> have Recorded it ſoon after, if it had been capable of any diſproof or confutation, whatever difficulties at this diſtance of time there may appear to us to be in it. And ſo in all other Caſes, we may depend upon it, that the Apoſtles and other Diſciples, who had ſuch demonſtrative Evidence for the conviction of Unbelievers by a conſtant power of Miracles, would never make uſe of any Arguments to the <hi>Jews</hi> from the Old Teſtament, but ſuch as they well knew their Adverſaries could never be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove or deny. For there were then certain
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:61773:514"/>Methods of Interpretation, as we learn from

                        <hi>Joſephus,</hi> which are now loſt, and they diſputed from acknowledg'd Maxims and Rules: the only difference and matter of diſpute was in the application of them to their particular caſe; however our ignorance of things, then generally known, may now make it difficult to reconcile ſome Texts of the New Teſtament with thoſe of the Old, from whence they were cited.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THIS is that Article of our Faith, which was <hi>to the Jews a Stumbling-block, and to the Greeks fooliſhneſs,</hi> 1 Cor. i. 23. and has ever been moſt liable to the Objections of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels;
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:61773:515"/>and therefore I ſhall take the more care to give the cleareſt and fulleſt account I can of it.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. I ſhall here conſider the neceſſity of the Incarnation of the Son of God, for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Juſtice, and the vindication of the honour of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Tho' it ſhould be ſuppos'd, that God could have pardon'd the Sins of Men upon any other terms, than the death and ſatisfaction of his own Son in our Fleſh; I hope fully to prove, that this is ſo far from being unworthy of God, that no other way of our Reconciliation with him (as far as we are able to apprehend) could have been ſo becoming the Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There ſeems to have been a neceſſity for the Incarnation of the Son of God, for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of God's Juſtice, and the vindication of his Honour. For God is Infinite Juſtice as well as Infinite Mercy; and Infinite Juſtice muſt puniſh Offenders, unleſs full ſatisfaction be made for the Offence; becauſe Infinite Juſtice muſt demand to the utmoſt extent of Juſtice, and muſt require whatſoever can in Juſtice be demanded. But Infinite Mercy found out a Means to ſatisfie this Infinite Juſtice; which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction could be made only by the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and by the Death of the Son of God, who by his <hi>Obedience unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs,</hi> vindicated the Honour of God, by performing in our Nature a perfect and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:61773:515"/>Obedience to all that ever God required of Mankind, and by ſuffering to the utmoſt of all that the Sins of the whole World deſerv'd. It is for the Honour of God, that his Laws ſhould be exactly obſerv'd, and obſerv'd by one who is of that very Nature, for which they were ordain'd; and that Satisfaction ſhould be made in the ſame Nature for the Sins of it: Chriſt therefore taking our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon him paid down <hi>the uttermoſt Farthing,</hi> which in ſtrictneſs of Juſtice muſt have been demanded, but which could never have been paid by any Created Being, for the Sins of the whole World: And he <hi>fulfill'd all Righteouſneſs</hi> in Obedience to the Divine Laws, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe could never have been fully obey'd. And as far as God's Juſtice and Honour was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to ſee his Laws obey'd, and to demand ſatisfaction for the breach of them; ſo far the Incarnation of the Son of God muſt be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, becauſe theſe things could be perform'd by no Creature.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Tho' it ſhould be ſuppos'd that God could have pardon'd the Sins of Men upon other Terms than the death and ſatisfaction of his own Son in our fleſh, yet the Incarnation and Death of his Son is ſo far from implying any thing unworthy of God, that no other way of our Reconciliation with him (as far as we can apprehend) could ſo much have become the Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs.</p>
                     <pb n="346" facs="tcp:61773:516"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is nothing in this whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation unworthy of God. Here I am to conſider that which was the great prejudice ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt the Chriſtian Religion at its firſt Propagation, and is ſtill the great Objection of the Enemies of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and of their own Salvation. They are apt to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it to themſelves as an unneceſſary thing, and unworthy of God, that he ſhould ſend his only begotten Son into the World for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Mankind; they imagine that the Infinite Wiſdom of God could have found out other Methods of Salvation for us, and that this would never have been made uſe of, if there could have been any other.</p>
                     <p>It might be enough in Anſwer to ſuch Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, to ſay with the Apoſtle; <hi>nay, but, O Man, who art thou that replyeſt againſt God? ſhall</hi> the Perſon ſaved, <hi>ſay unto him that</hi> ſaved him, <hi>why haſt thou</hi> ſaved <hi>me thus?</hi> will we not be contented to be ſaved, unleſs we can be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly certified in all the Reaſons and Methods of our Salvation? May not God bring to paſs our Redemption in ſuch a way as he ſhall ſee fitting, or ſhall we queſtion his Wiſdom, if his Mercy be ſo much greater than we can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend? How infinite is his Mercy, and how monſtrous our ingratitude, if his goodneſs be made an objection againſt the truth of his word, and be alledg'd as an Argument for our Unbelief? <hi>What if God willing to ſhew</hi> the heinouſneſs of Sin, and <hi>to make known the riches</hi>
                        <pb n="347" facs="tcp:61773:516"/>of his Mercy, choſe this way for the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World? What if many Reaſons may be given why this Method was the moſt proper and expedient; and what if there might be infinitely greater and better Reaſons for it, than all the wiſdom of Man can conceive?</p>
                     <p>But tho' the Revealed will and Counſel of God ought to ſilence all Diſputes in this as well as in all other Caſes; yet I think this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is capable of a very plain and direct Anſwer. For whatever weight there may ſeem to be in it, it is all grounded upon a Miſtake, and upon a wrong Notion of the Union between the Divine and the Humane Nature of Chriſt. For if the Godhead be not ſo united to the Manhood as to ſuffer with it, there is no imaginable Reaſon why its Union with the Manhood ſhould be ſuppoſed to be unworthy of God. I ſhall therefore</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Shew the unreaſonableneſs of this Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that the Union of the Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature in Chriſt ſhould cauſe the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head to ſuffer with the Manhood.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I will prove that the Humiliation of the Son of God in aſſuming our Nature, may be accounted for without ſuppoſing that the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head ſuffer'd.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the ſatisfaction of Chriſt by dying for our Sins may be explain'd without it.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. The unreaſonableneſs of this ſuppoſition, that the Union of the Divine and Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Chriſt ſhould cauſe the Godhead to
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:61773:517"/>ſuffer with the Manhood. This Objection ſuppoſes the Godhead to be ſo united to the Manhood in the Perſon of our Saviour, as that the Divine Nature muſt really and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly partake in all the Sufferings which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell his Perſon. It ſuppoſes, that Chriſt, as God, ſuffer'd the Miſeries of Humane Life, and at laſt underwent Death upon the Croſs; which is ſo far from being the Doctrine of the Goſpel, that it is no better than Hereſie and Blaſphemy, and has always been rejected and condemned as ſuch by the Catholick Church. That the Union of the Godhead with the Manhood, ſhould render the Godhead capable of Sufferings, as the Soul by being united to the Body becomes ſenſible of its pains, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a thing not only unworthy of God, but impoſſible to conceive. The Immortal and ever-bleſſed God can be ſubject to nothing of paſſion or frailty. The Godhead is uncapable of any imperfection, and therefore uncapable of receiving any impreſſions of Sufferings from the Humane Nature, as the Soul doth from the Body of Man. So that tho' the Union between the Divine and Humane Nature in Chriſt be fitly explain'd by that between the Soul and the Body in Man, yet the manner of acting is very different. For Finite Beings can mutually act and be acted upon by each other in their ſeveral actions and paſſions; but the Divine Nature of Chriſt being impaſſible, could ſuffer nothing by all that was inflicted on the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:61773:517"/>Humane, but remain'd infinitely Happy and Glorious under all the Torments and Agonies endur'd by our Saviour both in his Soul and Body.</p>
                     <p>As God is pleas'd to aid and aſſiſt and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port innocent and good Men in their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to direct and conduct them thro' the courſe of their Lives: So God was not only preſent with the Humane Nature of Chriſt, but was ſo united to it, as to become one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with it; which, ſince the Godhead could ſuffer nothing from it, is no more unworthy of God, than if he had only guided him with his Spirit, as he did the Prophets without any perſonal Union. There is no inconvenience or abſurdity in believing that God ſhould by the moſt intimate and perſonal Union become united to a Man, who did weep, and bleed, and die. For as God by this Union did not change the Nature he had aſſumed, or prevent the Sufferings of it, ſo he did not partake in them. No Man can deny <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>upon Principles of Philoſophy, but that it is very reaſonable to believe, that God may afford a more peculiar preſence to one Man than to another, and that this Man may yet be ſubject to Afflictions; and therefore the Son of God might become united to the Soul and Body of Chriſt in as intimate a manner as the Soul and Body are united to each other in us; and yet this union of the Divine Nature might not preſerve the Humane from the Sufferings incident to the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:61773:518"/>reſt of Mankind, but muſt leave it to ſubmit to them, tho' they were never ſo grievous, when this was the very End and Deſign of the Union.</p>
                     <p>It was not below the Majeſty of God to be Perſonally united to a moſt Innocent, and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and Holy Man, tho' he was a Suffering and Afflicted Man; and it is not the Perſonal Union, as ſome are apt to conceive, which could be any diminution to God's Glory, but their own error and miſtake, in what they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe would be the conſequence of ſuch an Union.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The Humiliation of the Son of God in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our Nature may be accounted for, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuppoſing that the Godhead ſuffer'd. It was the greateſt condeſcenſion and humiliation in the Son of God to take upon him our Nature: For it is a gracious and merciful condeſcenſion for him to take care of us by his Providence. <hi>God humbleth himſelf to behold the things that are in Heaven and in the Earth,</hi> Pſ. cxiii. 6. But ſome times and in ſome places he is in a more peculiar manner preſent upon Earth, and that is an extraordinary condeſcenſion; tho' he is always the ſame in himſelf, and never the leſs preſent or the leſs happy in Heaven. But it was the moſt wonderful condeſcenſion in God to unite himſelf to our Humane Nature, and to become one Perſon with it, and ſo to die for us; tho' his Divine Nature did not and could not ſuffer, but only the Humane Nature
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:61773:518"/>to which it is united. He was <hi>not aſhamed to call</hi> Men <hi>his Brethren,</hi> and <hi>in all things to be made like unto his Brethren,</hi> Hebr. ii. 11, 17. but vouchſafed to aſſume our Nature in its loweſt Condition, and to be ſo ſtrictly and perſonally united to the moſt afflicted of all the Sons of Men, as to aſcribe all his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to himſelf, for the benefit of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                     <p>It is the Infinite Mercy of God to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe us the comfort of his preſence in any way or meaſure: but it is the moſt aſtoniſhing and adorable act of his goodneſs, that he would be pleas'd ſo far to condeſcend, as to take our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nature upon him, that he might be born, and might die for our ſakes. And that which magnifies his mercy and goodneſs in the higheſt meaſure, is certainly moſt worthy of the good and merciful God.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The ſatisfaction of Chriſt by dying for our Sins, may be explain'd without ſuppoſing that the Godhead ſuffer'd. The Chriſtian Faith is, That <hi>as the Reaſonable Soul and Fleſh is one Man, ſo God and Man is one Chriſt;</hi> and that this Perſon conſiſting both of God and Man united, ſuffer'd for our Salvation: But that all the Sufferings were inflicted on the Humane Nature, and terminated in it. But by vertue of the Perſonal Union of his Divine with his Humane Nature, all Chriſt's Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings receiv'd an infinite value and merit, and became entituled and aſcrib'd to God himſelf,

                     <p>Thus God is ſaid to have <hi>purchas'd his Church with his own blood,</hi> Acts xx. 28. For Actions and Paſſions in any perſon are Perſonal, and are attributed to the whole perſon; and ſometimes thoſe Actions and Paſſions, which can be perform'd in one of thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures only, which conſtitute a perſon, are yet attributed to the other Nature, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of them otherwiſe than by that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which reſults from the union of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; whereby all things that befall the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, may be affirmed of it as ſuch, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have reſpect to both the Natures, of which it conſiſts, and may be apply'd to it, under the denomination of either of them. <hi>All the Souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Souls,</hi> Exod. i. 5. <hi>If a Soul touch any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing,</hi> Lev. v. 2. <hi>And the Soul that eateth of it, ſhall bear his Iniquity,</hi> Lev. vii. 18, 20. In theſe, and many other places of Scripture, Actions and Paſſions peculiar to the Body, are, by reaſon of the union of the Soul and Body, attributed to the Soul.

                     <p>And in other places the Body or Fleſh is often taken for the whole Man, and that is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to it, which the Fleſh is of it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of. The Fleſh diſtinctly conſidered, and apart from the Soul can neither Sin, nor Pray, nor Underſtand, nor Worſhip, nor par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Spirit, nor be Juſtified; and yet all theſe things are aſcribed to the Fleſh, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mention made of the Soul. <hi>All Fleſh had corrupted his way upon the Earth,</hi> Gen. vi. 12. <hi>O thou that heareſt Prayer, unto thee ſhall all Fleſh come,</hi> Pſ. lxv. 2. <hi>And all Fleſh ſhall know, that I the Lord am thy Saviour, and thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, the mighty one of Jacob,</hi> Iſa. xlix. 26. <hi>All Fleſh ſhall come to worſhip before me, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Iſa. lxvi. 23. <hi>And all Fleſh ſhall ſee the Salvation of God,</hi> Luke iii. 6. <hi>I will pour out of my Spirit upon all Fleſh,</hi> Acts ii. 17. Joel ii. 28. <hi>By the works of the Law ſhall no Fleſh be juſtified,</hi> Galat. ii. 16. And we ſay in our own Language, <hi>any Body thinks,</hi> or <hi>any Body underſtands;</hi> tho' we all know, it is the Soul, and not the Body, which thinks, and underſtands. It is very uſual in other Books, and very agreeable to the ſtile of Scripture, and to the common ſpeech and ſenſe of Men, for thoſe Actions of a Perſon to be attributed to one of the united Natures, which could be perform'd only in the other. And the Union between the Godhead and the Manhood being like that, which is between the Soul and the Body, the Son of God is ſaid to have <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,</hi>
                        <pb n="354" facs="tcp:61773:521"/>and the Son of Man to have <hi>come down from Heaven;</hi> not that the Godhead Suffered, or that the Humane Nature of Chriſt was in Heaven before his Incarnation, but according to the uſual ſtile of Scripture, the Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Divine and Humane Natures entitles the Perſon conſiſting of them both, under the denomination of either Nature, to that which was done in the other, tho' as the Humane Nature did not partake of the perfections of the Divine; ſo neither did the Divine Nature partake of the ſufferings of the Humane. But both Natures being perſonally united, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is ſometimes denoted by one, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the other Nature.</p>
                     <p>All the Objections againſt the Incarnation of the Son of God proceed upon the like mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake with theirs, who are apt to imagine that it is unworthy of God to be every where, and in all places, to behold and be preſent at the worſt of Actions; as if the Sun's brightneſs would not be the more reſplendent and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, if it could penetrate into the obſcureſt corners and receſſes of the Earth; or as if his Rays could be ſullied and defiled by the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of any Object which they ſhine upon. And if it be no diminution to God's Infinite Glory and Majeſty to be Omnipreſent, it can be none to be more nearly and even Perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united to ſome part of the Creation; and therefore it cannot be unworthy of God to be ſo united to the Humane Nature, to manifeſt
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:61773:521"/>his love and favour, and extend his goodneſs to Mankind. As God is every where preſent, ſo he is in a more eſpecial manner preſent in ſome places than in others by the acts of his Power, or of his Grace and Favour; and he has vouchſafed a more eſpecial preſence to ſome Perſons than to others; and thus he was preſent with his Prophets, who were ſent to prepare for and foretell Chriſt's coming. But he was perſonally united to the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt. And this is the higheſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Advancement to our Nature, for God thus to aſſume it; but it can be no diminution to the Divine Majeſty, becauſe God continues as he was from all Eternity, without any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; only by his perſonal Preſence and Union with our Humane Nature, he cauſes all the performances and ſufferings of it to be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, for the Salvation of Mankind.</p>
                     <p>The Son of God did not ſo come down from Heaven as to be no longer there, but to forſake his Father's Kingdom: He ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in Heaven in the ſame Bliſs and Glory, that he enjoy'd with his Father from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, tho' he ſo manifeſted himſelf to the World, as to come and abide in it by aſſuming our Humane Nature.

And it cannot be thought inconſiſtent with the Majeſty of God to actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the Humane Nature, and to be joyned in the moſt ſtrict and vital union with it, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God only to act upon it, and not to be acted upon by it, nor to ſuffer the miſeries and feel the pains which the Humane Nature endures (which would be Blaſphemy to aſſert of the Divine Nature of Chriſt) but to be in Heaven ſtill in his ſull Power and Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But ſome Man will ſay,</hi> how is this Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Divine and Humane Nature in Chriſt made, or wherein doth it conſiſt? To whom we may reply, as our Saviour ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times did to the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> by ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another Queſtion, and enquiring, how the Body and Soul in Man are united? or how God is preſent in all places? and how <hi>in him we live, and move, and have our Being?</hi> And if no Man can tell how theſe things are, tho' no Man can deny the truth and reality of them, then it is not to be expected, that we ſhould be able to tell how the union between the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:61773:523"/>and the Humane Nature in Chriſt is made, or in what it conſiſts. We muſt acknowledge it a Myſtery, which it is above any Man's ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to explain; but that there is ſuch an union, we learn from the Scriptures, and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we appeal for the truth of it. And the putting ſuch Queſtions, argues either a great mind to cavil, or great inconſideration, and ſhortneſs of thought. For what Man is there pretending to Reaſon and Argument, of ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle obſervation, as not to take notice, that of all the things which we daily ſee and perceive to be in the World, the nature and manner of exiſtence of very few or rather of none of them is fully underſtood by us? It is ſufficient for us to know, that great Reaſons may be given for this diſpenſation of the Son of God Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and that no Material Objection can be framed againſt it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> No other way (as far as we can apprehend) could have been ſo proper and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, as the Incarnation of the Son of God, to procure the Salvation of Mankind, and therefore none could ſo well become the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom and Goodneſs. The proof of this muſt depend upon the Reaſons for Chriſt's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the World, and they are all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in this one thing, the aboliſhing or taking away of Sin. <hi>And ye know that he was manifeſted to take away our Sins, and in him is no Sin,</hi> 1 Joh. iii. 5. We are to conſider then, that the manifeſtation of Chriſt in the Fleſh,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:61773:524"/>did more powerfully and effectually take away Sin, than any other way or means of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could have done.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. The Doctrine and Preaching of the Son of God had more Power and Authority with it than the Preaching and Doctrine of a Man or Angel could have had. <hi>God, who at ſundry times and in divers manners ſpake in time paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed Heir of all things, by whom alſo he made the Worlds,</hi> Hebr. i. 1, 2. <hi>Therefore we ought to give the more earneſt heed to the things which we have heard, leſt at any time we ſhould let them ſlip. For if the word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſſion and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience receiv'd a juſt recompence of reward, how ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great Salvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him?</hi> Heb. ii. 1, 2, 3. This being the laſt Meſſage which God had reſolv'd to ſend to Mankind, a Perſon of the greateſt Dignity and Authority was to bring it: <hi>But laſt of all he ſent unto them his Son, ſaying, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence my Son,</hi> Matt. xxi. 37. It is the laſt expedient, and the very utmoſt that could be done to reduce Sinners to Obedience; and if this will have no effect upon them, they muſt be leſt without all excuſe. This is the heavieſt aggravation of Sin, and that which renders Men utterly inexcuſable; <hi>he was in the World,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:61773:524"/>and the World was made by him, and the World knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not,</hi> Joh. i. 10, 11. If the only begotten Son of God had not come and manifeſted himſelf in ſo wonderful a manner to the World, ſomething of a Plea might have been pretended; but to reject the Son of God was an evident deſpight done to the Father, and even <hi>hating</hi> of the <hi>Father</hi> who had ſent him, as our Saviour declares, <hi>Joh.</hi> xv. 22, 23, 24. And the Blaſpheming of the Holy Ghoſt in thoſe, who vilified the Miracles of Chriſt, and aſcribed them to Beelzebub, was therefore without forgiveneſs, becauſe it was a rejecting of Chriſt, not as the Son of Man, but as God bleſſed for-ever; and a deſpiſing and vilifying that which is the laſt means that can be uſed to reclaim the World; and that means whereby he manifeſted himſelf to be the Son of God. To reject Chriſt, was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the whole Trinity, which was jointly concern'd in this wonderful diſpenſation.</p>
                     <p>The Dignity of Chriſt's Perſon adds all the force and efficacy to his Doctrine that is poſſible; and therefore it was requiſite that the Son of God ſhould become incarnate. God had before ſpoken from Heaven, but that was too terrible and full of Majeſty to be born by Mortals; and they that heard the voice, <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated that the word ſhould not be ſpoken to them any more: for they could not endure that which was Commanded; and ſo terrible was the ſight,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:61773:525"/>that Moſes ſaid, I exceedingly fear and quake,</hi> Heb. xii. 19, 20, 21. But now God was pleas'd to converſe with Man in a more familiar and humble manner; and our Bleſſed Saviour came to live amongſt Men with all the gentleneſs and meekneſs of the Humane Nature, and all the Authority of the Divine. <hi>For in him dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all the Fullneſs of the Godhead Bodily,</hi> Coloſ. ii. 9. The Godhead dwelt here in him under our Humane Nature, laying aſide that awful Majeſty, which no Man can approach unto.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. We have a greater Example of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Holineſs ſet before us by the Son of God Incarnate, than we could otherwiſe have had. It has been the general complaint made of other Teachers and Lawgivers, that they ſeldom obſerve their own Rules, or live them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves according to what they require of others. But our Saviour has given us an Example, if it be poſſible, even beyond his own Doctrine. For tho' he be no rigorous Lawgiver, but a moſt indulgent and gracious Maſter to us, yet he was pleas'd to excuſe himſelf from no Duty or Inſtance of Obedience, but fulfilled both the Moral and the Ceremonial Law: there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo mean, nor ſo difficult and painful but he perform'd it, to ſet us an abſolute Pattern of Obedience to the Whole Duty of Man, in all that ever God requir'd of Mankind. <hi>It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him to fulfill all Righteouſneſs;</hi> this was the end and intention of his coming into the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:61773:525"/>World, and he fulfilled it in the moſt abſolute and perfect manner, in all particulars. And to give ſuch an Example, is of unſpeakable uſe and benefit: for Men are more eaſily led by Example than by Precept; and it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerv'd, that it is Example for the moſt part which governs the World. Men will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Vices of thoſe whoſe Vertues they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver imitate; and the Faults of Wiſe and Great Men have too ſure and too fatal an effect upon ſuch, as their Excellencies never reach.</p>
                     <p>It was neceſſary that an Example of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute perfection ſhould be given to the World, and this Example muſt be given by one of the ſame nature with our ſelves, or elſe it might have been an Example for Angels and Spirits, but not for Men; and therefore ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample the Son of God Incarnate only could give, becauſe it was impoſſible for any created Being under all the Infirmities and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions incident to Humane Nature to live up to ſuch a Divine Height and Excellency of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as our Saviour did, and to leave ſuch an Example to the World.</p>
                     <p>He came not to teach us the wiſdom of this World, how to get Riches and Honours; in this Mankind was well enough inſtructed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and it could not but be unworthy of the Son of God to be Born into the World with a deſign to enjoy the pleaſures and the profits, and the honours of it, this was beneath the Majeſty of Heaven, and the Inſinite Perfection

                     <p n="3">III. The Mediation and Interceſſion of Chriſt for us is of greater power and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, than any could have been, if the Son of God had not become Man to die for our ſakes. <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim. ii. 5. he was to be Man as well as God, that coming with Divine Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and yet with the Affability and Acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of a Man, he might in all reſpects be
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:61773:527"/>fully qualified to perform the Office of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator between God and Man. If he had not been God, he could not have come with abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Authority to offer us Terms of Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; and unleſs he had been Men, he could not have treated with Men in ſo familiar and condeſcending a way upon theſe terms.</p>
                     <p>And the Right and Authority of Chriſt's Mediation and Interceſſion in behalf of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is founded upon his merits and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the Sins of Men; and this ſuppoſes him to be both God, and Man; <hi>Man,</hi> that he might Suffer and Die for us; and <hi>God,</hi> that his Divine Nature might give an infinite value to his Death and Sufferings, and render them ſatisfactory for the Sins of the World. Tho' it ſhould be ſuppoſed (which can never be proved) that God in his Mercy might have pardoned Sinners without the ſatisfaction of Chriſt; yet if in mercy he might have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, he might in juſtice have puniſh'd them, unleſs ſatisfaction had been made; and nothing could have made ſatisfaction to his Juſtice, but the Sufferings of his Son. The Obedience and Sufferings of no Created Being could have been of that value as to make ſatisfaction for the Sins of Mankind; and therefore no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could have Redeemed Man, or have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Mediator for him upon the terms of his own merits in Man's behalf, ſo as to plead the price of Redemption laid down for him. God may grant the Requeſts of Angels and Men,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:61773:528"/>out of his free Mercy and Bounty, but there can be no neceſſary force and efficacy in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions, where there is no precedent merit and ſatisfaction on the part of the Interceſſor. But Chriſt pleads his merits on our account, and mediates our Cauſe with his Father upon the terms of ſtrict Juſtice, and by vertue of the Ranſom of his own Blood; and is ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful an Interceſſor for us, that not only the Mercy and Goodneſs, but even the Juſtice of God cannot deny his Interceſſion. It was the free grace of God to ſend his Son to Suffer in our ſtead, but ſince he was pleas'd to admit of this Commutation of the Puniſhment which we had deſerv'd, and to tranferr it upon his own Son; his Death was <hi>a full, perfect, and ſufficient Sacrifice, Oblation and Satisfaction for the Sins of the whole World;</hi> which the death of no Creature could have been, and therefore no Created Being could have become our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator by vertue of his own Merit, and have ſatisfy'd the utmoſt Juſtice of God; much leſs could any Creature have merited the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Grace, and the Rewards of Glory for us.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. The Incarnation of the Son of God is the moſt effectual means to excite in us Faith, and Hope, and Charity, and unfeigned Love of God and of our Neighbour, the love of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and the hatred of Sin; and to diſpoſe and engage us to all Vertue and Piety. The Son of God aſſuming our Nature, gives us the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:61773:528"/>greateſt aſſurance of his compaſſion for our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and his deſire of our Happineſs. God is infinitely merciful in <hi>his own</hi> Divine Nature, but he never could give ſuch an inſtance of his mercy and love towards <hi>ours,</hi> as by taking it upon himſelf; God is eſſential Truth and Holineſs; and yet <hi>willing more abundantly to ſhew to the Heirs of Promiſe the immutability of his Counſel, he confirm'd it with an Oath;</hi> and in like manner in the preſent Caſe, God being willing to give us all the grounds for Faith and Confidence in him that can be imagined, took our Nature upon him, that <hi>by two immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table things, in which it was impoſſible for God to deceive, we might have a ſtrong Conſolation,</hi> both from the goodneſs of the Divine Nature, and from the tenderneſs and compaſſions of our own. <hi>For we have not an High-Prieſt, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be touched with the feeling of our Infirmities,</hi> and therefore are exhorted in this confidence, <hi>to come boldly unto the Throne of Grace,</hi> Heb. iv. 15, 16. vi. 17, 18. We are aſſured, that he has the greateſt concern for that Nature which he has taken into a perſonal Union with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and continually preſents before his Father in Heaven for us. And we are likewiſe aſſured of the Father's love towards us; <hi>For now we know</hi> that he loves us, <hi>ſeeing he has not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held his Son, his only Son from us,</hi> but ſent him into the World to die for our Salvation. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but deliver'd him up for us all; how ſhall he not with him alſo
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:61773:529"/>freely give us all things? Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect? It is God, that juſtifieth, who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh Interceſſion for us,</hi> Rom. viii. 32, 33, 34.</p>
                     <p>And as the manifeſtation of Chriſt in the Fleſh is peculiarly adapted and deſign'd to raiſe our Faith and Hope, and Truſt and Confidence and Dependance upon God, ſo it is above all the moſt prevailing motive to engage our Love. The infinite Love of Chriſt in dying for us, muſt needs require and even extort from us all poſſible returns of Love and Praiſe and Adoration.

                           </gap> Tom. 7.</note> St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> gives this as one Reaſon, why the Son of God was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, to become the Saviour and Redeemer of Mankind; becauſe if it had been poſſible for a Creature to undertake and effect our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Men would never have thought they could have had eſteem enough for him, or have made due expreſſions of their grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, unleſs they had Deified him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Idolatry in Worſhipping him, and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him all Divine Honours: and to prevent this in <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was but a Temporal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer, and but a Type of Chriſt, his Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre was conceal'd from the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> So dear is the memory of great and generous Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors wont to be, that Men are apt to think they never can be ſufficiently grateful to them, unleſs they even adore and worſhip
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:61773:529"/>them, which was one chief occaſion of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try among the Heathens; therefore the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the whole World was a thing that could belong only to the Son of God, to whom all Love and Reverence, all Worſhip and Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is due. And this being the great Aim and Deſign of the Chriſtian Religion to bring us to obey God upon Principles of Love, the Foundation of it is laid in the Love of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. Nothing can be conceiv'd, which could have ſo powerfully prevail'd upon Men to love God, as the Incarnation of his Son; and Love being the only principle of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which can be acceptable to God, this muſt be the moſt proper and ſitting diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is moſt apt to excite in us the Love of God. The Power and Majeſty of God had been manifeſted before in the Creation and Preſervation and Government of the World, and in many ſignal Judgments upon Sinners: the Divine Mercy and Goodneſs was likewiſe viſible in the daily Bleſſings beſtowed upon Mankind, but <hi>the exceeding Riches of his Grace</hi> was made known <hi>in his kindneſs towards us thro' Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Epheſ. ii. 7.</p>

<pb n="368" facs="tcp:61773:530"/>the Son of God has been pleas'd to digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that Nature in aſſuming it. This ought to make us value our own Nature, and to have a due eſteem and affection for it, in whomſoever it be. How can we deſpiſe and one who is a Partaker of that Nature, of which the Son of God has vouchſafed to partake in its meaneſt Condition? or hate any, whom he loved ſo well as to die for him? This makes all Men worthy of our reſpect and love, not of our contempt or hatred; they are of that Nature, which Chriſt, as Man, is of, and they are his Purchaſe, and we muſt love what is his, and what he has ſo dearly paid for, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>The Incarnation of the Son of God muſt likewiſe cauſe us to have the greateſt hatred and deteſtation of Sin, as being that which is moſt diſpleaſing to God, and that which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the death of his only Son to atone for it. And it is evident, that all who <hi>neglect ſo great Salvation,</hi> muſt expect the heavieſt Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for ſo heinous a Contempt and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation:
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:61773:530"/>if we will be gained by any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Love, Chriſt has done all that is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to effect it: But if we will not be moved by all the kindneſs and compaſſions of Love it ſelf, we can hope for no further favour; if the Son of God came to die for us, and we will not regard it ſo as to be made the better by it, nothing more can be look'd for, but <hi>Wrath and fiery Indignation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that the manifeſtation of the Son of God in the Fleſh was the moſt proper and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting means to work upon the Love, and Fear, and Hope, and all the Paſſions of Mankind, and to produce all thoſe Graces in us which the Goſpel requires.

                     <p>SInce we have ſo great Evidence to ſatisfie us that Chriſt did come into the World, and die for us, it would be the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and folly as well as Impiety to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him, tho' we ſhould not be able to give any exact account concerning the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the time of his coming. <hi>It is not for</hi> us <hi>to know the Times or the Seaſons, which the Father hath put in his own power,</hi> Acts i. 7. Theſe things are in God's diſpoſal, and unleſs we can be contented to leave the manner and circumſtances of our Salvation to his Wiſdom, we only ſhew how little we deſerve his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and how unwilling we are to believe them, and to accept of them. But tho' it be a mere Cavil to diſpute the coming of Chriſt upon a bare Circumſtance and Nicety concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reaſons for the particular time of his Incarnation; yet it will be eaſie to give ſuch an account of the time appointed for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of our Bleſſed Saviour, as may ſerve to ſilence all Objections againſt it; and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know any further of it is an uſeleſs and unwarrantable Curioſity; for all muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:61773:531"/>that God may have the beſt and wiſeſt Reaſons for his Diſpenſations, which yet we may not be able to comprehend, and which it doth not concern us to know. The Scripture teacheth us that Chriſt was born in the <hi>Fulneſs of Time,</hi> when all things were fulfilled and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in order to it, and the World was in a due readineſs and preparation for his coming.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. God had beforehand us'd all other means to ſhew the neceſſity of ſending his Son at laſt, for he was not to be ſent but upon neceſſity; and it was fit they to whom he was ſent, ſhould be ſenſible of that neceſſity, that they might the better know how to value the infinite mercy of God towards them, in ſending his only Son to be born and to die for them. In the beginning of the World, and at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopling it after the Flood, Revelations were ſo frequent, and the Will and Commands of God ſo well known, and his promiſe to ſend his Son ſo clearly underſtood, that there could be no neceſſity that Chriſt ſhould be Born then, ſince their Faith in him and their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God's Commandments was as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to the Salvation of them that lived ſo long before his coming, as it is to us, that live ſo many Ages after it. The Lives of Men in the beginning of the World were ſo long, and the generations-deceaſed were ſo few be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Flood, that nothing but wilfull igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and negligence could be the cauſe of ſo
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:61773:532"/>much wickedneſs. And after the Flood, the Race of Mankind being reduc'd to ſo few Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the Example and Inſtructions of <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the other Patriarchs might have been ſufficient to keep Men within the meaſures of their Duty, and to preſerve a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and expectation of the promis'd <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> For they were ſaved by their Faith in Chriſt to come, as we muſt be ſaved by Faith in him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come ſo many Ages paſt; and therefore to ſuppoſe it neceſſary that he ſhould be Born in thoſe Ages, we muſt ſuppoſe it neceſſary that he ſhould be Born in every Age of the World, which I think no Man will imagine.</p>
                     <p>But when the reſt of the World was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally fallen away to Idolatry, God choſe to himſelf one Perſon, from whom by a courſe of Miracles he raiſed a mighty Nation, who by their Journeyings and Captivities, and by all the diſpenſations of his Providence towards them, were appointed to make known his Name and Truth among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> In the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> this People it ſelf was uncapable of that pure and Spiritual Worſhip which the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to appoint, and ſtood in need of a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law and Service to reſtrain them from Idolatry, and to preſerve the ſenſe and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Promiſes and Laws deliver'd to <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Noah.</hi> And this Ritual Service was unworthy that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould come purpoſely to appoint it, who was indeed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the principal thing ſignified and typified
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:61773:532"/>by it; and the Types and Figures of himſelf could not be Inſtituted by himſelf in Perſon; for then they would have been inſignificant, and there could have been no uſe or occaſion for them. But the moſt Excellent and Divine Inſtitution was reſerv'd for his Appointment, to which all the reſt was but preparatory. The Law <hi>was added becauſe of Tranſgreſſions, till the Seed ſhould come, to whom the Promiſe was made,</hi> Gal. iii. 19.</p>
                     <p>After the Revelation of God's Will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments had thro' the great neglect and wickedneſs of Mankind become ineffectual, God <hi>ſent all his Servants the Prophets daily ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up early and ſending them;</hi> an expreſſion ſetting forth his great care and watchfulneſs over his People for their good, <hi>yet they heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not unto him, nor enclin'd their ear, but hardned their neck,</hi> Jer. vii. 25, 26. To Cure this ſtrange ſtubbornneſs, and their proneneſs to Idolatry, God ſent this People into Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for Seventy years; which wrought ſo tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough a Reformation in them, that they were never afterwards given to Idolatry, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd all extremities of Torments rather than they would be brought to any compliance with the Heathen Worſhip; and therefore there could be no longer ſuch neceſſity that the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law ſhould be continu'd to them to keep them from the Worſhip of Idols: But in other reſpects their Provocations were ſtill very great. And as the Lord in the Parable firſt
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:61773:533"/>ſent his Servants, and laſt of all his Son, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>they will reverence my Son;</hi> and thereby left thoſe wicked Men without excuſe, and manifeſted the Juſtice of his Vengeance upon the Murtherers of his own Son. So God firſt ſent his Prophets, and when the <hi>Jews</hi> who had been train'd in the knowledge and worſhip of him, and were to conveigh it to other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, would not be reclaim'd by them, but revil'd and deſtroy'd them, and then ſet up their own Traditions in oppoſition to their Doctrines; he ſends his Beloved Son before he would utterly take away their City and Nation, and effected that by the death of his Son, whom they Crucified, which the experience of ſo many Ages had ſhewn could be effected no other way.</p>
                     <p>God reveal'd himſelf <hi>at ſundry times and in divers manners,</hi> and in his Infinite Wiſdom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned the ways and meaſure of his Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the capacities and the neceſſities of the ſeveral Ages, in which they were made, till at laſt he <hi>hath ſpoken unto us by his Son,</hi> Heb. i. 1, 2. <hi>When we were Children we were in bondage under the Elements of the World: but when the fulneſs of the time was come, God ſent forth his Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law,</hi> Gal. iv. 3, 4.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Reception of Chriſt and his Goſpel in the World would have been much more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, if ſo many Prophets in ſo many ſeveral Ages had not foretold his coming. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:61773:533"/>himſelf and his Apoſtles after him appeal to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets for the truth of their Doctrine; this was the great Argument which they us'd to the <hi>Jews</hi> in Confirmation even of their Miracles themſelves, they prov'd that the Prophets had foretold that Chriſt ſhould come at that very time when he came, and that he ſhould work thoſe Miracles which he wrought, and ſhould empower his Diſciples to do the like: his Death and Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion, and the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt were all Propheſied of; and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies thus foretelling the Miracles, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles fullfilling the Prophecies, and both mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually confirming and ſupporting each other afforded all the Evidence that could be given; for Prophecies and Miracles are all the ways by which God can be ſuppoſed to reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Mankind. And therefore thouſands of the <hi>Jews</hi> were convinc'd out of the Scriptures that Jeſus is the Chriſt, and were Converted to the Chriſtian Faith. And the Prophecies concerning the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> are ſtill an unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Argument in vindication of our Religion; which Argument we muſt have wanted, if our bleſſed Saviour had come ſo much ſooner, as not to have been Propheſied of ſo many Ages beforehand. And thoſe who reject the Goſpel now, would have thought they had had much more Reaſon on their ſide than they can now pretend to have; for there had then been ſo much leſs means for their Conviction. So
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:61773:534"/>that the coming of our Saviour was deferr'd to give the greater Evidence, and the fuller con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of his being the Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>It would have been hard to believe that the Son of God ſhould come into the World with little or no notice given of it beforehand, and few or no Prophets ſent to foretell his coming, and prepare his way. But when he had been ſo long before Propheſy'd of, even from the beginning of the World, thro' the ſeveral Ages of it, when there had been a general expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to be born, and the Time and Place, and Tribe and Family and Perſon of whom he was to be born, by degrees, and at ſeveral times had been foretold; when Mens hopes and deſires to ſee him were thus from Age to Age awakened and alarmed, this was a Solemnity worthy to introduce and attend the Son of God into the World, and a Method which would prove a ſtanding Evidence of his being come into it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The time of Chriſt's coming may depend upon things which we are uncapable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For it may depend upon the duration of the World, and it is impoſſible for any Man to know how long that ſhall be. The Scripture ſpeaks of the times of the Goſpel under the Phraſe of the <hi>laſt Days,</hi> but this is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in relation not to the continuance of the World, but to the Chriſtian Diſpenſation, which is the laſt means of Salvation that God will vouchſaſe to Mankind, and with regard
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:61773:534"/>to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church and Government, which was juſt then at an end, as I ſhall ſhew in the next Chapter.</p>
                     <p>Now if the World may continue as long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſpenſation of the Goſpel as it had done before it (and no Man can tell but it may) we ſhall find little cauſe to wonder that Chriſt was not ſooner born into the World. For we find that the Faith and Zeal of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians decays, as we are at a farther diſtance of time from the Incarnation of our Saviour, and the firſt propagation of his Goſpel, and the length of the time it ſelf proves a temptation to ſome to disbelieve it; for men are apt to give leſs credit to what happened long ago, and to think themſelves leſs concern'd in it. If therefore Chriſt had been born at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World, how many more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences would thoſe Men have feigned to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their Infidelity, who are now ſo prone to unbelief, and ſo unwilling to be Chriſtians?</p>
                     <p>Men are tempted to ſuſpect that there is ſomething of obſcurity and uncertainty in all things long ſince paſt; and if Chriſt had been born a thouſand or two thouſand years ſooner, thoſe who now think he came too late, would then have cavilled that he came too ſoon, and that it was too long ago to be believed, and had happened in a dark and fabulous Age. And therefore it ſeems that Chriſt came in the very ſeaſon and centre of time; that as the
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:61773:535"/>former Ages were not ſo remote as not to be capable of all the benefits of his Death and Paſſion to be in due time accompliſh'd; ſo the laſt Ages of the World may have no pretence to queſtion the truth of the Chriſtian Religion upon any account of the long diſtance of time ſince the Death of our Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. This may be the Caſe for ought any Man can tell, or many other Reaſons there might be much better and more important than this, to deferr the Incarnation of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and therefore it is an abſurd thing to raiſe Objections about it. Many Reaſon there might be for it, which we are uncapable of knowing; and it is ſufficient for us to know, that it was <hi>in the fulneſs of time,</hi> and that this time was the moſt proper and expedient, and therefore was the time appointed and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God from all Eternity.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. God had by the various Methods of his Providence given ſuch ſignal opportunities to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to become acquainted with the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, as did mightly prepare them for the acknowledgment of Chriſt at his coming into the World. All the Diſpenſations of the Divine Providence from the Beginning, had been as ſo many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral preparations to the Birth of Chriſt, God choſe <hi>Abraham</hi> to be the Father of a peculiar People; and when that People had been by the conſtant manifeſtation of a miraculous Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence preſerv'd, and by their Laws and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:61773:535"/>diſtinguiſhed from all other People, they were driven into Captivity, as well in mercy to other Nations, as by God's juſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them for their Sins, that by this means the <hi>Gentiles</hi> might be inſtructed in the Worſhip of the true God, and the Prophecies concerning Chriſt might become divulged, and all Nations might be in a readineſs to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and receive him who was to be <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of all Nations,</hi> and the joy of all People. Firſt, the Ten Tribes were by <hi>Shalmaneſer</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away Captive, and then the two remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tribes by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> was by Name appointed to reſtore them. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>'s Conqueſts made yet way for a farther reception of the Prophecies, which were the moſt conſiderable about the time of the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. And beſides the Prophecy of <hi>Balaam,</hi> by which the Wiſe Men were directed to find out Chriſt by the guidance of a Star, thoſe of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> muſt be well known in the Eaſt. The Bible had been about three hundred years before our Saviour's Birth, at the Command of a Heathen Prince Tranſlated into the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, which was by the Victories of <hi>Alexander</hi> become the moſt known Language in the World. And we read of no Revolution of Empires, no Bleſſing, no Affliction which befell the <hi>Jews,</hi> but it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed in a remarkable manner to raiſe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of Chriſt, and to prepare for his Coming.</p>

                     <p>It is certain, that at the time of his <hi>Birth,</hi> there was among the <hi>Jews</hi> an Univerſal expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and that it was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Opinion in that Age all over the Eaſt, that a great Prince ſhould ariſe out of <hi>Judea,</hi> this appears both from the Scriptures, and from
<note n="(z)" place="margin">Sueton. <hi>in Veſpaſ.</hi> c. 4. Tacit. <hi>Hiſt.</hi> lib. v.</note> Heathen Writers; the Wiſe Men came to enquire after him, and <hi>Herod</hi>'s Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie proceeded to the utmoſt Rage and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and could not have failed of ſucceſs, if it had been againſt any but the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whom God did by an immediate Revelation deliver out of his hands. All the World ſtood in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of ſome extraordinary Perſon, and it was no unwellcome piece of Flattery to one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors not long after, to have it reported, that he was the Prince ſpoken of and expected in the Eaſt, but it was eſteemed his Glory and his Happineſs to be thought the King that was to ariſe amongſt a deſpiſed and hated People. The expectation of Chriſt was ſo great, that he could not lie conceal'd in that obſcure and mean Condition, but was adored in a Manger, and receiv'd more than Royal Honours from the remoteſt parts of the Earth. And in this reſpect it was <hi>the fulneſs of time,</hi> or the moſt convenient and proper time for Chriſt to appear, becauſe the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had wonderfully diſpoſed and prepared the World for the expectation of him.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The particular temper and diſpoſition of the Age in which our Saviour was born, made
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:61773:537"/>it the moſt fitting and proper Age for him to be born in; for there were ſeveral things peculiar to that Age, which very much conduce to the proof of the certainty of his Religion. That Age was ſo remarkable, and the Hiſtory of it has been delivered down to us by ſo many eminent Writers, that it is more ſtudied, and generally better known than any Age of the World beſides; and it was fit that a thing of this nature and conſequence ſhould come to paſs in ſuch an Age, that it might be fully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into, in any Age afterwards, and that no diſtance of time might cauſe ſuch doubts concerning it, as ſhould ever render it the leſs certain to any, who are willing to acquaint themſelves with the truth of it.</p>
                     <p>If it had been an Impoſture, this ſurely had been the moſt unlikely time of any for it to ſucceed. No Prince could be more jealous than <hi>Herod,</hi> who was ſo enraged at the Report of the Birth of Chriſt, that he too plainly ſhew'd how much he credited it. And no Age perhaps ſince the Creation could be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to have a Cheat put upon it than this; in which Peace and Learning and all Polite Arts flouriſh'd, which refine Men's Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and make them the moſt unfit and difficult to be impoſed upon. Policy was in its higheſt perfection in the Courts of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius,</hi> which have been eſteemed the greateſt Patterns of it ever ſince; the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were in great Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

Vice, which was likely to give the greateſt hindrance to a holy Religion, was the faſhion of the times, and that Empire was never ſo abandoned to wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, as at the firſt propagation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. As Men were then moſt able to diſcover any Impoſture, ſo they muſt have been moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to find the Chriſtian Religion true, which puts ſuch a check to all Licentiouſneſs, and to their beloved and long accuſtomed Vices. Vice would be ſure to make a ſtrong defence, and an eager Plea, and nothing could be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for it to diſcover, when it had ſuch a number of ſuch ſubtle and devoted Advocates.</p>
                     <p>In this Conjuncture of time the Saviour of the World appears, and he appears in a mean and low Condition, deſpiſed by his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who ſoon became as much deſpiſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by all the World beſides. The Prince of Peace is Born in a time of ſetled and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Peace, when Men had moſt leiſure and opportunity to examine and conſider things; and when by the Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire under <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in its full power and extent, there was an open and free Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence between all Nations, and the Apoſtles and their Followers by this means might find a like admittance to preach the Goſpel in all Countries, but to be alike hated and perſecuted in all parts of the World. The
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:61773:538"/>Religion of Chriſt was not to make advantage of any Troubles and Confuſions in the Empire, as that of <hi>Mahomet</hi> afterwards did, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it ſelf by its own worth and efficacy to the moſt ſerious and impartial Minds; and under all theſe diſadvantages it ſoon made its way into the Emperor's Court, where Craft and Luxury, and every thing that is moſt contrary to the purity and ſimplicity of the Goſpel reigned. St. <hi>Paul</hi> had his Proſelytes in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s <hi>Houſhold,</hi> and his <hi>Bonds in Chriſt were manifeſt in all the Palace, and in all other places</hi> at Rome, <hi>Phil.</hi> i. 13. iv. 22. The truth of the Goſpel approved itſelf to the moſt prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Judgments, it ſtood all the Trials, and Conquer'd all Oppoſition, that Wit and Learning, and Vice it ſelf could make. For by the leave of the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Deiſts</hi> of our own Age, the Chriſtian Religion found the ſubtileſt and moſt dangerous Adverſaries at its firſt propagation. The <hi>Epicureans</hi> and the <hi>Stoicks</hi> encountred St. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> and theſe laſt eſpecially were inferiour to no other Sect of Philoſophers; either for their obſtinacy in adhering to their own Opinions, or for their Art and Skill in Diſputation. And it appears from the ſeveral Apologies made afterwards in vindication of our Religion, that all was at the very firſt alledged againſt it, which can with any pretence or colour be objected.</p>
                     <p>Thus was Chriſt Born in the fulneſs of time, when all the Prophecies concerning his coming
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:61773:539"/>were fulfilled, and when the World was in expectation of him, and had ſuch general no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his coming; in a time the moſt unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for an Impoſture to paſs undiſcover'd, and therefore the moſt ſeaſonable for Truth to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt it ſelf; ſince that muſt needs be true, which neither Learning, nor Prejudice, nor Vice, nor Intereſt could prove to be falſe. The accompliſhment of Prophecies, and the Converſion and Martyrdom of ſuch numbers of Men in ſuch an Age, recommends the Goſpel to us with all the advantage which any Juncture of Time could give.</p>

                     <p n="1">I. The laſt Days of the World are ſeldom mention'd directly, and in expreſs terms, but under ſuch Reſemblances as were fit to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them in the deſcription of other Events.
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:61773:539"/>For it was a known thing among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that their whole Diſpenſation being Typical, whatever happened to them under their Law and Government, muſt afterwards be fulfilled in a more eminent manner under the Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and Diſpenſation of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laſt Days of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> muſt be Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal of the laſt Days of the World. For the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the Concluſion of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſation was only a Type of the final Deſtruction of the World at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of all things, when Chriſt ſhall <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 24. For which Reaſon our Saviour makes uſe of ſuch words, <hi>Matt.</hi> xxiv. as are applicable to both of theſe events, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more fitly to the laſt Judgment, that after the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the reſt remains ſtill to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed at the Day of Judgment. But there are likewiſe ſuch Expreſſions uſed, as evidently ſhew that the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is the thing immediately deſigned in the Prophecy. This will appear, if we conſider ſeveral Verſes of that Chapter. <hi>Then let them which be in Judea, flee into the Mountains,</hi> ver. 16. and that with the greateſt haſt; <hi>for let him which is on the houſe top not come down to take any thing out of his houſe,</hi> v. 17. <hi>Neither let him which is in the field, return back to take his Cloaths,</hi> v. 18. But the Condition of ſuch would be very miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, who ſhould be unfit for flight. <hi>And woe
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:61773:540"/>unto them that are with Child, and to them that give ſuck in thoſe days,</hi> v. 19. <hi>But pray ye that your flight be not in the Winter, neither on the Sabbath Day,</hi> v. 20. There will be no flying from the general deſtruction of the World, but the Diſciples are here warned to fly from the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and eſcape into the Mountains, and they are commanded to pray that their flight might be hindred neither by the ſeaſon of the year, nor by the Sabbath, on which the <hi>Jews</hi> were permitted to travel but a very little way. Which ſuppoſes that the World was to laſt after the Tribulation there ſpoken of; and that therefore the final deſtruction of this material World is not the thing there immediately meant. <hi>And except thoſe days ſhould be ſhortned, there ſhould no Fleſh be ſaved: but for the Elects ſake thoſe days ſhall be ſhortned,</hi> v. 22. If this Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhould have raged long in that manner, no Man of the <hi>Jews</hi> could have ſurvived it, but it was to be ſo abated and ſo ſoon over, that the converted <hi>Jews</hi> might be preſerved from it; which Promiſe was very remarkably and wonderfully fullfilled to the Chriſtians at the Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who made their eſcape into the Mountains, and retir'd to <hi>Pella. For whereſoever the Carcaſs is, there will the Eagles be gathered together,</hi> ver. 28. which is a plain alluſion to the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles, or the Standards of their Armies. <hi>Immediately after the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

This was in ſome reſpect litterally fulfilled at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But it is uſual with the Prophets by theſe Figures to deſcribe the Deſtruction of Nations, and the falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are ſtyl'd by St. <hi>Jude,</hi> ver. 13. <hi>wandring Stars,</hi> becauſe the true were as the Sun and fix'd Stars. <hi>Balaam</hi> Propheſy'd that a Star ſhould <hi>come out of Jacob, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </head>
                     <p>THO' the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law was very requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite at that time, and for that People, when it was in force, and the wiſeſt and beſt Inſtitution that could have been, yet it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a yoke, and ſuch a yoke as was burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and not to have been born, but in ſure hopes and expectation of better things to come. And at the approach of the Son of Righteouſneſs theſe ſhadows vaniſhed, and the Types having attained their end and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, were laid aſide; and in their room Chriſt has Inſtituted as few Rites as it was poſſible; only the two Sacraments; one for our Initiation, and firſt Reception; and the other for our Re-eſtabliſhment and Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that Covenant, which he has been pleas'd to make with us. And yet even theſe are thought too many by ſome, who as if they were all Soul and Spirit without Body, are only for a Mental and Spiritual Worſhip. To vindicate therefore the Inſtitution and uſe of Sacraments, I ſhall <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Deſign of Sacraments in General; <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew how fully the two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper anſwer the End and Deſign of the Inſtitution of Sacraments.</p>
                     <pb n="396" facs="tcp:61773:546"/>
                     <p n="1">I. I will enquire into the Nature and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Sacraments in General. Sacraments may be conſider'd, either, 1. as outward and viſible Signs of our entrance into Covenant with God, or of our renewing our Covenant with him. Or, 2. As Pledges of God's Grace and Favour towards us. Or. 3. As the Means and Inſtruments, whereby he is pleas'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey into our Souls the bleſſed Influences of his Holy Spirit. Or, laſtly, they may be conſider'd as viſible Rites, whereby we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the viſible Society of Chriſt's Church, or profeſs our Communion with it. And in all theſe reſpects it will appear, how beneficial and requiſite the Inſtitution of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments is, and how fitting it is that God in his Diſpenſations with Men ſhould appoint ſomething outward and viſible to be done, or received by them.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Ceremonies and Rites of Initiation and of Worſhip have been Inſtituted in all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, which is Evidence ſufficient, that the Nature of Man requires them, and that our Worſhip cannot be wholly Mental and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. And God is pleas'd in his Dealings with Mankind, to condeſcend to their Capacities, to aſcribe to himſelf their Paſſions, to allude to their Cuſtoms, and to make uſe of ſuch Means and Methods as Men are accuſtomed to in their Dealings with one another. He beſt underſtands Humane Nature, and knows all the diſpoſitions and tendencies of it; <hi>he
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:61773:546"/>knoweth our frame, he remembreth that we are duſt,</hi> Pſ. ciii. 14. He conſiders that we are Fleſh as well as Spirit, he fully comprehends the ſtrict Union between the Soul and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the cauſe and manner of it, and how great influence the one hath upon the other in their ſeveral Operations; he planted in us all our Powers and Faculties, and ſees all their Motions and Inclinations, the ſecret Springs of Action and Paſſion, and has accordingly fitted and proportioned the Inſtitution of his Laws and Ordinances.</p>
                     <p>We ſee among Men, that they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent only to underſtand one anothers Meaning, or to expreſs their Minds in words, tho' they be the moſt ſolemn and ſignificant; but are wont to uſe ſome Ceremony and Solemnity of Action and Circumſtances in matters of great Importance; becauſe this makes greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon the Mind, and lays upon it a more forcible and laſting engagement by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the Senſes and Paſſions, as Parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with it; and this is by experience found to have the beſt effect to all the ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of Agreement and Obligation between Men. Oaths themſelves are not found to be ſo ſecure to be rely'd upon, when they are only pronounc'd, as when they are taken with ſuch Circumſtances of words and geſture, as may create an awe and reverence in thoſe who take them. For the manner and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in which any action is done, raiſe and

                        <pb n="398" facs="tcp:61773:548"/>fix the Attention, and expreſs the Mind and Deſign of the Doer, and are better retain'd in the Memory, and work more upon the Will and Affections, than the Action of itſelf can do. This Orators very well underſtand; for the Art of Rhetorick is almoſt nothing elſe but a skilfull management of the circumſtances of actions to the advantage of a Cauſe. And Philoſophy informs us, that the evil or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Actions depends chiefly upon their Circumſtances; from whence we learn what the intention of the Mind is, and to what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Reſolution it came in the performance of any Action. If an Action be performed at a ſolemn time and place, in the preſence of Witneſſes met together for that very purpoſe, upon great deliberation; with ſuch words and geſtures as are very ſignificant to expreſs our full Deſign and Intention; all theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances conſider'd make it much more our own proper Act and Deed than if it were done without them, tho' the Intention were the ſame. For what we declare before others to be our mind and purpoſe to do or undertake, we cannot but think our ſelves bound to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der more obligations than if we barely deſign'd it, or promis'd it only to the Perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd; becauſe the deſign of declaring it is to lay upon our ſelves a farther obligation to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, and to call others as Witneſſes againſt us, if we neglect the performance of it; and ſince our Reſolution may be declar'd as well
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:61773:548"/>by Actions as by Words; he that expreſſes his Reſolution both theſe ways, ſhews a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſign to oblige himſelf, than if he ſhould only uſe words to expreſs it; and if the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Actions be ſtated, and ſolemn and ſignificant, then all the ways and means concurr, by which it is poſſible for Men to declare and expreſs their Minds in any Caſe, and to oblige themſelves to the performance of any Covenant.</p>
                     <p>Now Sacraments are the Seals of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between God and Man, and when God is pleas'd to receive Men into Covenant with himſelf, it is requiſite that Men ſhould not barely give their aſſent to the Terms and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it, and declare that they will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake them; but it is farther neceſſary that this ſhould be done with all the Solemnity of Words and Actions that may engage them to the performance of it, and render them inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable if they tranſgreſs it; it is fitting it ſhould be entred into, and renewed in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Witneſſes, that the Words ſhould be Solemn, and the Actions Significant, and that nothing ſhould be wanting, which may te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the Sincerity, and ſecure the Fidelity of the Undertakers. For if Covenants between Man and Man be made with all the formality of Witneſſes, and Hands and Seals, and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very in ſolemn and expreſs words; if Men know themſelves too well to truſt one another without all this Solemnity, it may well be
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:61773:549"/>expected, that when God is pleas'd to permit them to enter into Covenant with himſelf, he ſhould not receive them under leſs Obligations of Caution and Security for their Integrity, than Men are wont to uſe amongſt themſelves. For every breach of Covenant with him, is infinitely more affronting and ſinful than any breach of Covenant with Man can be; and therefore God, who will not be mocked, has appointed the moſt effectual Means to ſecure his Laws from contempt; he knows the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of Man's heart, how perverſe and ſtubborn it is, eſpecially in things of ſuch a Nature as theſe are of, to which Men are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by that Promiſe and Vow that they are required to make to him; and that all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints and all the Remembrances which Words or Actions can afford, are little enough to keep Men in any tolerable meaſure to their Duty.</p>
                     <p>God was pleas'd to confirm his Promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> with an Oath; and therein ſhew'd himſelf willing to give all the aſſurance that the moſt Incredulous Man can deſire, of the fix'd and unalterable ſtedfaſtneſs of his purpoſe, and the <hi>Immutability of his Council, that we might have a ſtrong Conſolation,</hi> Heb. vi. 17, 18. And when God himſelf is pleas'd ſo far to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend for our comfort and ſatisfaction, it is moſt reaſonable that he ſhould oblige us to perform our part of the Covenant, by all the ways that may put us in remembrance of our
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:61773:549"/>Duty, and make us faithful and conſtant in the performance of it. And this could be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by no better Means, than by outward Acts and viſible Signs to teſtifie and profeſs in the moſt ſerious and ſolemn manner, what our inward Faith and Reſolutions are. This is that ſort of ſecurity which Men have of one another, and when God makes a Covenant with Men, he conſiders them as Men; that is, he appoints ſuch Solemnities of it as have reſpect to the Body as well as to the Soul; he doth not deal with us as with immaterial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but as with Creatures conſiſting of Soul and Body, and who little regard, and are little affected with that, which doth not ſome way concern the one as well as the other.</p>
                     <p>And it is ſtrange to ſee to what Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies thoſe have proceeded, who have ſet up for a purely Spiritual Worſhip without any thing Sacramental for a viſible Sign in it. For not to mention the Pretenſions of our Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts, who by decrying the uſe and neceſſity of Sacraments, have made Religion nothing but an empty and uncertain Name amongſt them. <hi>Prophyry,</hi> who was a Man of Study and Learning, after he had Apoſtatiz'd from the Chriſtian Religion, upon a ridiculous Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, as Hiſtory relates it, was aſhamed to return to the Heathen Idolatry, which after the appearance of Chriſtianity in the World, ſoon became too notoriouſly abſurd and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable for any Man pretending ſo much to
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:61773:550"/>Reaſon and good Senſe to own it; but he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all Divine Worſhip in Mental Prayer, and ſo far rejected all outward and Bodily Worſhip,

And the very ſame Notions were taught by

                        <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius Tyanoeus,</hi> and have been revived of late by ſuch as undervalue all outward Ordinances, which may be a Warning to others, and an Evidence of the Divine Wiſdom in appointing Sacraments as outward and viſible Signs of our Covenant and Communion with God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As theſe outward Signs ſerve to raiſe our Attention and fix our Minds, and to put us in Remembrance, that Heaven and Earth, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men are Witneſſes againſt us, if we prove treacherous and unfaithful in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; ſo they are as Tokens and Pledges to us of God's Love and Favour, and of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and gracious Intentions towards us, in taking us into Covenant with himſelf; they give us ſenſible and viſible Aſſurances of that Grace, which is inviſible and Spiritual. And this ſeems but neceſſary for Creatures that are led ſo much by Senſe, as we all are in this Life, that God together with his Word and
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:61773:550"/>Promiſes ſhould beſides appoint ſomething, which may be perceiv'd by our Bodily Senſes in Token of thoſe Bleſſings which are beſtow'd upon the Soul, that what is no Object of Senſe, may yet be repreſented and ſignified by ſomething that is ſenſible; to bring, as far as it is poſſible, the moſt Divine and Heavenly things down to our very Senſes; which may be a Sign and Token of preſent Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and a Pledge and Earneſt of future Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Happineſs. And this is what is found very uſeful and neceſſary amongſt Men, who are better contented with ſomething preſent and in hand, tho' of little value, and inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant in itſelf, as a Token and Pledge of what is promiſed and made over to them, than they are with the greateſt Promiſes and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations without any thing as an Earneſt to confirm them; becauſe this is a Natural Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that they are indeed in <hi>Earneſt</hi> (as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> word expreſſes it) and really intend what they ſay, and it may be produced againſt them, if they ſhould fail of Performance. Now what is inward and inviſible is abſent as to Senſe, and what is future has need of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing preſent to repreſent it to us: And God who was pleaſed to bind himſelf even by an Oath for our farther Comfort and Truſt in him; has been pleaſed likewiſe, that he might be wanting in nothing, which might help our Infirmities and aſſiſt our Faith; he has been pleaſed in condeſcention to the Condition and
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:61773:551"/>Frailty of Humane Nature, to appoint viſible Signs and Pledges of that which is Inviſible, and to give all the Aſſurance to our very Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that they are capable of, that all the Promiſes of his Spiritual Bleſſings and Graces ſhall as certainly be fulfilled to us, as the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Signs and Pledges are appointed for us, and duly received by us.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Sacraments are not only Signs and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of Spiritual Gifts and Graces, but they are ordained as Means and Inſtruments of Grace and Salvation to us, that as the Body partakes in the Moral Actions of Vertue and Vice, ſo it might concur in the Religious Acts ordained for our Sanctification. For God, who has made us ſo as to conſiſt of Soul and Body, and to have the Vital Union between Soul and Body depend upon a fit Diſpoſition of the Body, and to be maintained by the Health and Nouriſhment of it, has been pleas'd to appoint certain Bodily Actions as the Means and Inſtruments of our Spiritual Life, that the Soul might not even in this Caſe, where itſelf is more immediately concern'd, be wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of the Body; but that ſince both muſt be either happy or miſerable together in the next Life, both might concurr in the way and means of Salvation in this; yet ſo, as that the Soul ſhould be the firſt and principal Agent, and the Body ſhould act only in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination and ſubſerviency to it in this, as it doth in other Caſes; that as in Moral Actions
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:61773:551"/>the Soul acts vertuouſly or viciouſly by the Body; ſo in Spiritual Actions the Soul might receive Advantage and Benefit by Bodily Acts, and be deprived of it upon the Omiſſion or Neglect of ſuch Acts.</p>
                     <p>The Body without the Soul is not the Man, nor the Soul without the Body, but both Soul and Body together, and the whole Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes dedicated and conſecrated to God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Service in the uſe of Actions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed outwardly in the Body. And it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that the Body as well as the Soul ſhould be thus dedicated to God in Token of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Body, and of that Happineſs which it muſt receive in Heaven, if the Soul be happy. St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to <hi>glorifie God in their Body as well as in their Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. vi. 20. he tells them, that <hi>the Body is not for Fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the Body: know ye not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that your Bodies are the members of Chriſt? what? know ye not, that your Body is the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> There have been thoſe in ſeveral Ages, who have made ſuch high Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to Spiritual Worſhip, that they would allow the Body no part or ſhare in it; and others from the great irregularity and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption which they could not but obſerve in their Carnal Appetites, have concluded that the Body was made not by God, but by a wicked Being, and that the Soul only was from God. Since therefore God is pleaſed to

It is the great and gracious Deſign of God to ſanctifie the whole Man, and therefore Chriſt took not only an Humane Soul, but Humane Fleſh likewiſe, to dignifie it in the Aſſumption, and offer it upon the Croſs, and tranſlate it into Glory. And as his Incarnation ſhews the particular Regard he has for the Body as well as for the Soul of Man, ſo the whole Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel hath relation to both.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Laſtly, The Sacraments are Foederal Rites of our Admiſſion into the Church, as into a viſible Society, and of our Union with it as ſuch. For we cannot be admitted into a viſible Society, nor communicate with it, but by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and outward Acts, which muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the Body.</p>
                     <p>So that whatever way we conſider the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, either in reſpect of God, or of our ſelves, or of others, there is a neceſſary uſe
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:61773:553"/>and benefit from them, and evident Reaſon for their Inſtitution. They are requiſite as Symbols of our entrance into Covenant with God, or of the Renewing and Confirmation of it, and of Dedicating both our Bodies and Souls to his Honour and Service; they are Inſtruments of his Graces, and Pledges of his Promiſes made to us by Covenant, and of the Reward and Happineſs both of our Bodies and Souls at the Reſurrection; and are viſible Marks and Evidences of our Profeſſion, as Members of the Church, of our Admiſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and our Communion with it.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The Sacraments of Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper fully anſwer the End and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Inſtitution of Sacraments. After the coming of Chriſt, and the fulfilling of the Ceremonial Law by him, it was of no longer uſe or continuance, the Goſpel being to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Spiritual Service, by teaching Men to <hi>worſhip God in Spirit and in Truth:</hi> Yet there was need of ſome external Ordinances or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, the Nature of Man, and the State of this World requiring them; but that they might be as few as poſſible, Chriſt has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed but two Sacraments <hi>as generally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation,</hi> and theſe the fitteſt and moſt expedient for the benefit and wants of Men.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to Baptiſm, the Reaſons and Deſigns in the Inſtitution of Sacraments are all viſible in it. It is a very ſignificant and apt Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:61773:554"/>of the cleanſing and purifying the Soul from Sin, and in this Men of all Nations and of all Religions ſeem to have been agreed. For nothing was more frequent among the <hi>Heathens</hi> than their Waſhings and Purificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and tho' they attributed a great deal too much to them, yet the ſuperſtitious Opinion which they had of theſe outward Cleanſings, could never have ſo univerſally prevail'd, if there had not been ſome Foundation for the uſe of them in the Nature of Things, and that is the great fitneſs which is in theſe outward Waſhings to excite us to purity of Mind, and to repreſent the great Duty which lies upon us, to keep our Conſciences undefiled, which only can render us accepted with God.</p>
                     <p>And as theſe Waſhings and Purifications were common in other Religions, ſo the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Church was wont to receive Proſelytes or Converts by Baptiſm; for which Cuſtom they alledge the command of God to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> xix. 10. but
<note n="(i)" place="margin">Hebr. &amp; Talmud <hi>Exercit.</hi> on <hi>Matt.</hi> iii. 6.</note> Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> ſets it higher, and thinks it was begun by <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> xxxv. 2. And our Saviour, who both in his Words and Actions throughout the whole Goſpel condeſcended to a compliance with the Cuſtoms in uſe among the <hi>Jews</hi> ſo far as they might be ſerviceable to the ends of the Goſpel, was pleaſed to make choice of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm for the Admiſſion of Perſons to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his Religion, as the <hi>Jews</hi> uſed it for the Admiſſion of their Proſelytes.</p>
                     <pb n="409" facs="tcp:61773:554"/>
                     <p>Baptiſm is very agreeable to the Nature of the Chriſtian Religion, being a plain and eaſie Rite, and having a Natural ſignificancy of that Purity of Heart which it is the deſign of the Goſpel to promote and eſtabliſh in the World; and it is fitted to repreſent to us the cleanſing of our Souls by the Blood of Chriſt, and the Grace of Purity and Holineſs, which is conveyed in this Sacrament, and the Spirit of Regeneration which is conferred by it, <hi>John</hi> iii. 5. <hi>Tit.</hi> iii. 5. And it being in uſe both amongſt <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> it was ſo much the more proper, becauſe both had already an Opinion of the expediency of it. Chriſt came to aboliſh the Ceremonies of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law, and the vain and idolatrous ſuperſtitions of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Worſhip, and yet ſome outward Rite of Worſhip was neceſſary to be made uſe of, to dedicate the Body as well as the Soul to God's Honour and Service, to be a Pledge of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Body, as well as of the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Soul, to put Men in mind of that Integrity and Purity of Life which the Goſpel requires, and to be a means of conveying it, and to admit them as viſible Members into the Church. And as Baptiſm was very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to be Inſtituted upon all theſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts; ſo it had this peculiar advantage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any other Rite, that it was already in great uſe and eſteem, and could ſeem ſtrange neither to <hi>Jews</hi> nor <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but it had been a very ſtrange thing to both, and very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable

                     <p n="2">2. The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is ſo often the ſubject of Sermons, and of every good Chriſtians Meditation, that very little needs to be here ſaid of it. For it is evident that the Elements of Bread and Wine have a peculiar ſuitableneſs to bring to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the Body and Blood of Chriſt offer'd upon the Croſs for us, to make us Partakers of them, and to be Pledges of all the Benefits which we receive thereby. And as the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt was appointed by Chriſt in the room of the Paſchal Supper, ſo Bread and Wine were in uſe among all Nations in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worſhip, and nothing can more fitly expreſs our Communion with God and with one another, than to be entertained together at God's Table.</p>

                     <p n="3">III. That the Belief of this Doctrine doth mightily tend to the advancement of Vertue and Holineſs, and hath a great influence upon the Lives and Converſations of Men.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is no Contradiction in this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, We are ignorant of the Eſſences of Created Beings, which are known to us only by their Cauſes, and Effects, and by their Operations and Qualities; and our Reaſon and Senſes and Paſſions being continually conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant about theſe, our Notions are formed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ideas which we frame to our ſelves concerning the Creatures, and this makes us the leſs capable of underſtanding the Divine Eſſence, beſides the infinite Diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Nature of God, and Humane Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. When we ſay, that God is an Infinite and Incomprehenſible Being, we ſpeak the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſenſe of Mankind, and no Man cavils at it; but becauſe the Scriptures repreſent this Incomprehenſible Being to us under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, that is Matter of Cavil and Diſpute. Whereas God being eſſentially Holy and True, we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him to be what he declares himſelf to be in the Scriptures, and he being Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, we may not be able to comprehend it. If God be infallibly True, why do we
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:61773:557"/>not believe what he delivers concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? And if he be Incomprehenſible, what Reaſon can be given why the Divine Eſſence may not ſubſiſt in Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt? Theſe are ſtyled Three Perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we find diſtinct Perſonal Acts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties attributed to them in the Scriptures, and we may ſuppoſe Three Perſons in the Unity of the Divine Nature without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of contradiction.

                     <p n="2">2. The Unity of the Divine Nature.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Difference between the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and Humane Perſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Diſtinction of the Three Perſons in the Deity. The Divine Nature is in Three Perſons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt; in the Father Originally without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Generation or Proceſſion; in the Son, as communicated to him by the Father, not in any ſuch way as Sons amongſt Men have their Nature derived to them from their Fathers, but yet in ſome ſuch manner as is beſt expreſt to our Apprehenſions by ſtyling him the Son of God, tho' the manner of his Generation is altogether incomprehenſible to us. The Holy Ghoſt has the Divine Nature communicated to him from the Father and the Son, not in the ſame way whereby the Son has it communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him from the Father, but in ſome
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:61773:558"/>other different incomprehenſible manner, whereby he is not begotten, but proceeds both from the Father and the Son. The Divine Nature is communicated by the Father to the Son by Eternal Generation, and by the Father and the Son to the Holy Ghoſt by Eternal Proceſſion: We have nothing further revealed to us of the Generation of the Son, but that he is begotten, or received the Divine Nature from the Father in ſome ſuch way, as, for want of a fitter Word, we can beſt underſtand by the Term of Generation; and the Scripture teacheth us no more of the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, but that he is not begotten of the Father, as the Son is, but proceeds from the Father and the Son ſome other way, and not by Generation. But as he that would Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to a Man born Blind concerning Light, muſt uſe many very improper expreſſions to make himſelf, tho' never ſo imperfectly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; ſo it is here; we have no words that are proper, but theſe are ſufficient to teach us all which we are capable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at leaſt all that is neceſſary for us to know of the Godhead.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Unity of the Divine Nature. To ſay that Three Gods are one God, or that Three Perſons are One Perſon is a manifeſt Contradiction; but to ſay that Three Perſons are (not One Perſon, but) One God, is ſo far from a Contradiction, that it is a Wonder how it ſhould be miſtaken for One by any
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:61773:558"/>who underſtand what a Contradiction means. <hi>The Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghoſt is God, and yet they are not Three Gods, but One God.</hi> For neither of theſe Three Perſons is God diſtinct and ſeparate from the reſt, but they all are but One God; <hi>One Lord</hi> (Jehovah) <hi>not Three</hi> diſtinct and ſeparate <hi>Lords,</hi> and ſo <hi>not Three Eternals, nor Three Incomprehenſibles, nor Three Uncreated, nor Three Almighties,</hi> diſtinct and ſeparate from each other; but all the Three Perſons toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are One Eternal, Incomprehenſible, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created, Almighty Lord, God.</p>
                     <p>It is Matter of Diſpute, what is the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Individuation</hi> in Men, or what it is which cauſes one Man to be a different Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Perſon from another; and it is ſtill more difficult to find out the Principle of Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in Beings which are purely Spiritual, and have nothing of Material Accidents to diſtinguiſh them. But whatever the Principle of Individuation in Men may be, it is certain that the Conſequence of it is, that two Men may exiſt ſeparately both as to Time and Place, and that one may know more or leſs than the other, they may live at a diſtance the one from the other, and can never at once ſill the ſame Numerical Place, nor is their Knowledge the ſame: there is nothing in their common Nature to determine them, that they ſhould be born or die together, or that there ſhould be any mutual communication of the

So that this Principle of Individuation, whatever be aſſigned to be it, cannot belong to the Divine Nature, which is Omnipreſent, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and Omniſcient; the Exiſtence, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and Local preſence of Men are <hi>Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> not <hi>Eſſential,</hi> but Omnipreſence, Eternity, and Omniſcience are <hi>Eſſential</hi> Attributes of God, and not <hi>Perſonal,</hi> or do not belong to each Perſon, as they are diſtinguiſhed from one another, but as they are united in the ſame Eſſence; for they are predicated of the Father, as God; of the Son, as God; and of the Holy Ghoſt, as God; and not of each ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally, as Father, as Son, and as Holy Ghoſt. Every of theſe <hi>Eſſential</hi> Attributes therefore cannot be numbred with the <hi>Perſons</hi> in the Deity, but can be but One, as the <hi>Eſſence</hi> itſelf of the Deity is, and tho' <hi>the Father be Eternal, the Son Eternal, and the Holy Ghoſt Eternal, yet they are not Three Eternals,</hi> or Three Individual Beings of Eternal Exiſtence, as Three Humane Perſons are Three Men of a Finite Exiſtence. It is a Contradiction that there ſhould be Three ſeparate Infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; for their being ſeparate muſt ſuppoſe them to be Finite, or to have a limited and confined Subſiſtence; and therefore Three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Perſons can be but One God, or One Being, which has all the perfections of Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:61773:561"/>Diſtinction, without the imperfection of the Diviſion of Perſons.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From hence appears the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Divine Perſons and Humane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The Perſons of Men are diſtinct Men as well as diſtinct Perſons, but this is no ground for us to affirm, that the Perſons in the Divine Nature are diſtinct Gods, becauſe the Divine Nature is acknowledged to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and Incomprehenſible, and when we ſpeak of Three Perſons in it, we do not mean ſuch Three Perſons as Three ſeveral Men are. But we read of the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the Father, <hi>Hebr.</hi> i. 3. and of <hi>Three, that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe Three are One,</hi> 1 Joh. v. 7. and when we ſpeak of Three Intelligent Beings, we can have no Conception of them, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Notion of Perſons. We learn from the Scriptures, that there are Three Perſons in the Deity, which bear that Relation to each other, which is beſt expreſs'd by the Terms of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; but the Terms of Father, Son, and Spirit are not therefore ſo to be underſtood, as they are in Humane Relations, and the word Perſon is not to be underſtood, as it is of Humane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and therefore whereas we uſe the word <hi>Perſon,</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> call them <hi>Subſiſtencies,</hi> but acknowledge that they mean the ſame thing under that difference of words.</p>
                     <pb n="418" facs="tcp:61773:562"/>
                     <p>And yet this is all the foundation of any pretence of contradiction in the Notion of the Bleſſed Trinity, that Men will needs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Terms of Perſon, and of Father, Son, and Spirit, when they are applied to God, as they do, when we ſpeak of Men, and from thence they conclude, that Three Perſons in the Divine Nature muſt be Three Gods, as Three Perſons amongſt Men are Three Men; and that the Father muſt be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour and Elder than the Son, as it is in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Generations. But this is all Miſtake; <hi>Adam</hi> is ſtiled <hi>the Son of God</hi> in a ſenſe of the word peculiar to himſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> iii. 38. God is in one ſenſe the Father of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and in another ſenſe he is the Father of the Regenerate only; and when in either ſenſe we call him <hi>our Father,</hi> we take not the Word <hi>Father</hi> in the ſame ſenſe that we take it in, when we apply it to Men; and when we ſay he is the Father of his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, this is another ſenſe of the word <hi>Father,</hi> very different from all the former. The Relation between the Father and Son is not the ſame in the Nature of God, that it is amongſt Men, nor are the Divine Perſons ſuch as the Perſons of Men are; but theſe are the fitteſt, and the moſt proper and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Terms, to expreſs the Nature of God to us, that Humane Language and Humane Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings are capable of. We muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that there is a vaſt diſproportion
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:61773:562"/>and impropriety in theſe expreſſions, and that they give us but a very imperfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Divine Nature, but it is the moſt perfect that we are able to have of it, or that it is neceſſary for us to have of it in this Mortal ſtate; and if we will but allow for the incompetency of our own Faculties to have Words and Notions adequate to the Divine Nature, and will remember that God is God, and that we are but Men, there will appear to be no contradiction in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Trinity.</p>
                     <p>The Divine Nature is ſuch, that it has Three diſtinct Principles of Operation and Subſiſtency, which are ſo deſcribed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the Scriptures by Perſonal Acts and Properties, that we know them to be as really diſtinct as Humane Perſons are, which yet being but One God, cannot in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect be like Humane Perſons. And whoever will oppoſe this Doctrine of the Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, muſt prove that the Three Perſons of the Trinity cannot be as really diſtinct, as the Perſons of Three Men are, tho' they are not ſuch Perſons, as the Perſons of Men. And to prove this, he muſt underſtand the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, as well as he underſtands the Nature of Man; for otherwiſe he can never be able to prove that Three Divine Perſons may not be One God, tho' Three Humane Perſons cannot be One Man. That they are diſtinct Perſons is revealed, and that theſe
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:61773:563"/>Three diſtinct Perſons are but one God is revealed, but wherein the Diſtinction and the Unity of theſe Three Perſons conſiſts is not revealed, nor is it poſſible for us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, at leaſt without a Revelation. The Diſtinction of the Perſons of Men is founded in a ſeparate and divided Subſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but this cannot be the foundation of the Diſtinction of the Divine Perſons, becauſe Separation and Diviſion cannot belong to an Infinite Nature. There is then not Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy in ſaying that there are Three Subſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, or Three diſtinct Principles of Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Acts and Properties in one undivided In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Nature, or that the Perſons in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity act as diſtinctly and perſonally, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons do amongſt Men, but are united in one Infinite Nature, which is uncapable of exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſeparate Subſiſtencies, tho' not of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſubſiſting in Three diſtinct Perſons, or as diſtinctly from each other, as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons among Men do act and ſubſiſt.</p>
                     <p>The Summ is, that in the moſt perfect Unity of the Divine Nature, do ſubſiſt the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whom is a real Diſtinction, which tho' not the ſame, yet is equivalent to the Diſtinction of Perſons among Men. That there is this Unity and this Diſtinction, we learn from the Scriptures, but what kind of Diſtinction this is, or how far it is to be reconciled with our Notion of Perſons amongſt
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:61773:563"/>Men, and after what manner it is conſiſtent with the Unity of the Godhead, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have not told us, and it is impoſſible for us to determine.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Other things are, and muſt be believed by us, which are as little underſtood as this Doctrine. Our Knowledge at the beſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Finite Things is very imperfect, which is ſo generally acknowledged by all Men of Wiſdom and Experience, that it is eſteemed a great point of Wiſdom for a Man to be truly ſenſible of his own ignorance; and it is the Character, which <hi>Solomon</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf giveth of the Fool, that he <hi>rageth and is confident,</hi> Prov. xiv. 16. But when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider things Infinite, we are much more at a loſs. That there muſt of neceſſity be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Eternal, muſt be acknowledged by all, who underſtand what is meant by the word; even thoſe that are ſo <hi>fooliſh,</hi> as to <hi>ſay in their hearts there is no God,</hi> yet muſt believe ſomething elſe to be Eternal; they muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there always was ſomething, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if ever there had been nothing, there never could have been any thing. For how could any thing have been produced by No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? Out of Nothing it might, but then there muſt have been ſomething to produce it. We can be certain therefore of Nothing, if we are not ſure of this, that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Eternal; the Atheiſt himſelf cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, unleſs he be ſo ſtupid as not to know
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:61773:564"/>what it means. And yet what apparent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions may he fancy to himſelf in the Notion of Eternity? For what is Eternal can never be capable of either a ſhorter or a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Duration than it always had; ſo that Millions of Ages hence it will not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued longer, than it had done as many Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of Ages paſt. And how ſtrange and contradictory doth this ſeem to be, that not only Three Ages and one Age ſhould be the ſame, but that there ſhould be no difference between one Hour or Moment, and never ſo many Ages in reſpect of Eternity. And there is no avoiding this difficulty, if a Man be of any Religion, or no Religion, let him but apprehend what is meant by Eternity, and he muſt own both that there is ſuch a thing, and that he is utterly unable to explain it. Here then is an unaſwerable Difficulty in a thing which all the World muſt believe, if they have it but ſo propoſed to them, as to be made underſtand what it is. And there is no difficulty imaginable in the Doctrine of the Bleſſed Trinity, which can be pretended to be greater, than that which is inſeparable from this Notion, which all muſt of neceſſity hold.</p>
                     <p>And if we do but obſerve it in Finite things, which are uſual and familiar to us, and the Objects of our Senſes every day, we Believe what we very little underſtand, or are capable of underſtanding. Our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:61773:564"/>indeed is ſo very imperfect concerning the Nature of moſt things, that I may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt venture to ſay, that if we will but be contented for the preſent to believe what God has delivered concerning his own Nature, we may hereafter know God himſelf as plainly as now we know many things here. <hi>For now we ſee through a Glaſs darkly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then ſhall I know, even as alſo I am known,</hi> 1 Cor. xiii. 12.</p>
                     <p>If it be thought unreaſonable however, that ſuch abſtruſe Myſteries ſhould be made neceſſary to Salvation, and that we ſhould pronounce that <hi>whoſoever will be ſaved, muſt thus think of the Trinity,</hi> and that all who do not thus think and believe, ſhall <hi>without doubt periſh everlaſtingly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let it be conſidered, that in all Religions, whether Natural or Revealed, there muſt be ſomething believed, which is above all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Comprehenſion, and which can be known no further than in order to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; there can be no Faith without all Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but Knowledge, if it were compleat, would exclude Faith, which is <hi>the Evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> Knowledge may be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either as it <hi>is general</hi> and imperfect; or as it is <hi>particular</hi> and adequate to the Nature of the thing known; we muſt have a general Knowledge of whatever is the Object of Faith, but if we had a particular and adequate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, there could remain nothing of it

                        <pb n="424" facs="tcp:61773:566"/>unknown, to be the Object of Faith. The difference between Science and Faith is, not that we are leſs certain of the Objects of Faith, than of the Objects of Science, but that we know leſs of them. For Certainty depends upon our <hi>general</hi> Knowledge, as that God is true; and therefore what he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, is as certain, as if we ſaw it, or could demonſtrate it in every particular. And this <hi>general</hi> Knowledge, which is neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Faith is, in Natural Religion, attained to by Reaſon, and in Revealed Religion, from Revelation. Thus we attain to ſuch a <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Knowledge of the Divine Nature by Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Evidence, as to be convinced, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power, and Goodneſs, and Truth, and all manner of Infinite Perfections belong to it; but we believe the Divine Perfections without any particular comprehenſive Knowledge of them; in like manner, from Revelation we attain to this <hi>general</hi> Knowledge, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature conſiſts of Three Perſons in One undivided Eſſence, but we believe theſe Three Perſons to be One God, without any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and comprehenſive Knowledge of ſo great a Myſtery; for then it would no longer be a Myſtery, and Faith would be no more Faith.</p>
                     <p>I would therefore ask the Adverſaries of this Doctrine, whether the Belief of a God, Omnipreſent, Eternal, Almighty, Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, Infinitely Holy, Juſt, and Merciful, be
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:61773:566"/>not neceſſary to Salvation? No rational Man can deny it. I enquire further, whether In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants and Ideots are obliged neceſſarily under pain of Damnation to this Belief? They muſt certainly anſwer, no; becauſe none can be obliged to Impoſſibilities. I demand then again, whether, if one or more of theſe At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, or the Agreement of them one with another be impoſſible to be underſtood (with a <hi>general</hi> and imperfect Knowledge) by any who are capable of knowing and believing the reſt; the ignorance of theſe Articles, which are above their Underſtandings (even as to this <hi>general</hi> and imperfect way of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) can be deſtructive of their Salvation? They muſt needs ſay it cannot, becauſe God can require nothing impoſſible of any Man. And the very ſame Anſwers applied to the Cavils againſt the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed will be ſufficient to Silence them. That Creed contains ſuch Truths as are neceſſary to be believed in order to Salvation, but neceſſary to particular Perſons ſo far only, as they are capable of knowing them, in order to believe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. <hi>He that will be ſaved, muſt thus think of the Trinity;</hi> but this ſuppoſes him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of thinking thus; for it is ever ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and agreed in all Caſes, that no Man is bound to any thing impoſſible; and that God requires nothing of any Man either in Faith or Practice beyond his Power and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. <hi>Whoſoever will be Saved, before all
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:61773:567"/>things it is neceſſary, that he hold the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith; which Faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he ſhall periſh everlaſtingly.</hi> But this ſuppoſes that he has already attained, or is able to attain to the Knowledge which is neceſſary to Faith, for no Man can hold that Faith, the <hi>general</hi> Knowledge whereof he cannot attain. We muſt with an implicit Faith believe all that God ſays to be true, tho' it be never ſo much above our Underſtanding; but no Man is bound to believe explicitly any more than he can underſtand ſo far, as is neceſſary to ſuch a Belief. He is able to underſtand ſo much of it, as to know in general what he is required to believe, tho' he can have no ſuch compleat and comprehenſive Notion of it, as to give a particular and full Account of the Nature and Manner of Exiſtence of that which is to be believed by him.</p>
                     <p>And let the Articles of Faith ſuppoſed neceſſary to Salvation according to Natural Religion be never ſo few and plain, yet there will ſtill be ſome Men, who are unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of underſtanding them in any way or meaſure; and then there will lie the ſame Objections againſt thoſe Articles of Natural Religion, which are upon this Account ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt their Faith in the Trinity it ſelf; which, ſo far as it is required to be known and believed, is not above the Capacity of the Generality of Mankind; and no more is
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:61773:567"/>required to be believed explicitely of any, than they are capable of knowing in ſuch a Degree as is neceſſary in order to ſuch a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; whatever Articles of Faith be aſſigned in Natural or Revealed Religion, they will be above the Capacity of many Adult Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and of all Infants to apprehend them; who therefore according to all Religions may be Saved without the actual Knowledge of thoſe Articles which are never ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to others. And what may be objected againſt all Religions, Natural as well as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, ought in Reaſon to be objected againſt none; for there can be no force in it.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. This Doctrine exceedingly tends to the advancement of Vertue and Holineſs, and has a great influence upon the Lives and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations of Men.</p>
                     <p>That God the Father ſhould ſend his Son, his only Begotten, and only beloved Son to be Born and to Die for us, is an endearing and amazing Act of the Divine Goodneſs. The Death not of a meer Man, but of the Son of God, Bleſſed for ever, in our ſtead, muſt needs heighten our Love of God, and our Faith and Dependance on him; our Hatred of Sin, and our Aſſurance of Pardon upon Repentance. This I have proved at large in Diſcourſing of the Incarnation and Death of the Son of God for us, and therefore ſhall not inſiſt upon it here.</p>
                     <pb n="428" facs="tcp:61773:568"/>
                     <p>In like manner, whatever the Holy Ghoſt hath done, and is continually doing for us, muſt needs be of more weight with us, and give us quite another Notion and Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Goodneſs and our own Duty, than we could have had, if we believed him to be a Creature. For unleſs we believe him to be God, we cannot have that devout Love and Faith, and Dependance upon him, which we ought, we cannot have that Eſteem and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for his Communion and Preſence, which is required of us, nor that ſenſe of the heinouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sin, whereby we reſiſt, and grieve and do deſpight to him. That Argument of St. <hi>Paul, what know ye not that your Body is the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> and many other to the like purpoſe, would be loſt, but on ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that the Holy Ghoſt is God. We can never have that Senſe which it behoves us to have of our Sins committed in oppoſition to the Gifts and Influences of his Grace, without an acknowledgment of his Godhead. So that our Faith, and Hope, and Fear and Love is more excited and enlarged, and all the Powers and Faculties of our Souls are more diſpoſed to the obedience of the Goſpel, thro' the belief of this Doctrine of the Trinity, than they could be without it. And therefore as there is nothing abſurd, or impoſſible to be believed in this Doctrine, ſo it was very reaſonable and expedient that it ſhould be revealed.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXV. <hi>Of the</hi> RESURRECTION <hi>of the Dead.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our Saviour from the Dead, was that which the Apoſtles chiefly inſiſted upon in all their Diſcourſes: For if once they could convince Men, that Chriſt was Riſen from the Dead, they could not fail of perſwading them into a Belief of all that they Taught beſides. There was no other Part of their Doctrine which could ſeem more ſtrange and incredible than this; and when that, which they could with ſo much Difficulty be brought to believe, and which could not come to paſs but by the Almighty Power of God himſelf, was evidently and undeniably proved to them, this muſt give that Credit and Authority to all their other Doctrine, that it could be no longer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood or gain-ſaid. This therefore is the Point which the Apoſtles moſt of all urged, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if they could gain this, all the reſt would follow of Courſe, and that every Man muſt of neceſſity be Converted to the belief of the whole Goſpel of Chriſt, who was once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his Reſurrection.</p>
                     <pb n="430" facs="tcp:61773:569"/>
                     <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Defence before King <hi>Agrippa</hi> puts the Queſtion, <hi>Why ſhould it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God ſhould raiſe the Dead?</hi> Acts xxvi. 8. which implies, that it is a very unreaſonable thing to think, that God cannot Raiſe the Dead, and that therefore there was all the Reaſons in the World to believe that he had raiſed Chriſt. For there was ſo great Evidence of his Reſurrection, and ſo many Men daily Witneſſed it at the peril of their Lives, that if their Adverſaries would but allow the thing to be poſſible, there could be no Doubt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, but that Chriſt was indeed raiſed from the Dead.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle Argues that it is a very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd thing to ſay, that God cannot raiſe the Dead. What Reaſon could any Man give why God cannot do it? Or how durſt any Man ſo limit and confine the Infinite Power of God by his own Notions and Conceptions of things, as to ſay that the Reſurrection of the Dead cannot be effected by him? This is unreaſonable and abſurd in the higheſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and therefore it is manifeſt that Chriſt is Riſen, and that there is to be a General Reſurrection of the Dead, ſince there is no other Objection that can lie againſt it, but the Impoſſibility of the thing it ſelf. For our Reſurrection is aſſerted in the Scriptures, as a neceſſary Conſequence of Chriſt's Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 20. and his Reſurrection
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:61773:569"/>was ſo well atteſted, that the greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Chriſtianity could not deny the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Fact, ſuppoſing the thing poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; but they would not own it poſſible, that ſuch a thing ſhould be, and upon that account rejected all the Evidence that could be produced, as tending only to prove an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility, and ſo not to be regarded. I ſhall therefore ſhew the poſſibility of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Dead, and that it is unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to think it incredible that God ſhould raiſe the Dead.</p>
                     <p>If it be incredible, that God ſhould Raiſe the Dead, it muſt be upon one of theſe Two Accounts; either becauſe he cannot, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will not do it. For what God both can and will do, is ſo far from being Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that it is a moſt undoubted Truth. Therefore I ſhall</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Prove that God is certainly able to Raiſe the Dead; and,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That he certainly will do it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That God is certainly able to Raiſe the Dead, is a thing credible in it ſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be eſteemed incredible by no ſort of Men whatſoever, tho' they have no Knowledge of any Revealed Religion, if they have but right Apprehenſions concerning God. No Man can have a true Notion of God, but he muſt know that God is a Being of Infinite Power and Wiſdom; that he made the World, and all things therein; that he preſerves and
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:61773:570"/>ſuſtains all Creatures, and that all things are wholly at his Will and Diſpoſal, to do with them as he pleaſes; that nothing can oppoſe or reſiſt his Will, or give him the leaſt hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance in any thing which he is pleaſed to undertake. How then can it ſeem incredible that God ſhould raiſe a Dead Man to Life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, when he at firſt gave him his Life? And is it not as eaſie to reſtore it to him, as to give it him at firſt? Might we not as well diſpute that it is impoſſible for a Man to be Born, as that it is impoſſible for him to be Raiſed from the Dead, if our own experience did not convince us of that, but not of this? God, who gave all that Power and Ability, which Natural Cauſes have to produce their Effects, may, if he pleaſes, produce the ſame Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects immediately by himſelf. For it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſtands in need of any help from Natural Cauſes, that he has appointed them, but becauſe it ſeemed beſt to his Infinite Wiſdom to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point this Courſe and Order in the World.</p>
                     <p>And it is evident even to Natural Reaſon, that there muſt have been ſome who were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Created by God, and were not born of others, as Men are ſince, that there muſt have been ſome <hi>Firſt Parents,</hi> ſome, who had no Parents themſelves, but were of Gods immediate Creation, that there muſt have been ſome who were the Firſt of all Mankind, and therefore could be born of no others. Since then Man muſt of neceſſity
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:61773:570"/>have been firſt formed by God himſelf, and not have come by a Natural Birth into the World; it is evident, that God might have made as many Men and Women after this manner as he had pleaſed; and he, who is the Author of our Nature, may act without it, and as much beyond and above any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Powers and Faculties in his Creatures, as it ſeems beſt to him. And it may as well be thought incredible, that God ſhould at firſt make Man, as that he ſhould be able to raiſe him up again after Death; for Death is only the End of Nature's power of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not of the Power of God himſelf; who, as he originally made the Race of Mankind, ſo he appointed the Nature of Things, and gave it a ſtinted Power, which it cannot exceed; but his own Power is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and no Bounds can be ſet to it.</p>
                     <p>When a Man is once Dead, Nature has done with him, and can never recover him to Life again; for God ordained at firſt that according to the Courſe of Nature he ſhould only be born, and live here a while; not that his Life ſhould be reſtored again to him after Death. But he is not ſo confined himſelf, that he cannot give Life to the Dead, but has reſerved this as his own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and above any thing in Nature's Power. God, who formed <hi>Adam</hi> of the Duſt of the ground, might have formed all
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:61773:571"/>Mankind ſo, if he had pleaſed; and he can as eaſily raiſe all Mankind to Life again out of the Duſt, as he made the firſt Man out of it.</p>
                     <p>And the Atheiſt, one would think, has of all Men the leaſt pretence to ſcruple the Reſurrection of the Dead, who muſt ſuppoſe that Mankind at firſt ſprung out of the Earth as Plants do, by a Spontaneous Production; and for him to pretend that the Bodies of Men cannot be raiſed to Life again by an Almighty Power is as unreaſonable, as any thing in Atheiſm it ſelf can be.</p>
                     <p>When at certain Seaſons every Year, we ſee things receive a New Life, as it were, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Courſe of Nature, we may well conclude, that if ſo ſtrange an Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can proceed from Natural Cauſes, then ſurely God is able to effect that which is much more wonderful, and to raiſe even theſe Bodies of ours after they are dead and rotten in the Grave, to Life again. And ſince the Corn which is Sown in the Earth, <hi>is not quickned except it die,</hi> and will not revive and grow again and come to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unleſs it be firſt buried in the Ground, and undergo great Alterations there; it is a fooliſh thing, as the Apoſtle argues, to doubt of the Reſurrection of the Dead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot underſtand the way and
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:61773:571"/>manner of it. Let Men Anſwer all the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties in Nature, and it will be time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough afterwards to diſpute with them about a Reſurrection; but when we are at a loſs about the moſt common and obvious things, it muſt be great Preſumption to deny the Reſurrection, becauſe we cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it; when alas! what is there beſides that we are able to comprehend? Will we preſume to ſay that God can do nothing, but what we underſtand how it may be done; when every thing we ſee, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us that his Wiſdom is Infinite, and <hi>his ways paſt finding out.</hi> Indeed if we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood every thing elſe, there might be ſome pretence to ſcruple the Reſurrection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we do not underſtand how it ſhall be. But when our Ignorance is ſo notorious in all other things, it is the heighth of Folly and Perverſeneſs to think our ſelves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judges of ſuch a Myſtery as this. So far are we from being able to make any Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of God's Power, and ſo far is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from being Incredible, becauſe there may be Objections made about it, which may ſeem unanſwerable; that if no other Anſwer could be given, this would be ſufficient, that God can do more than we can have the leaſt Thought or Conception of; and that it is no Argument that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do what we cannot conceive how it
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:61773:572"/>ſhould be done, ſo long as there is nothing contrary to the Divine Nature in it, nor which implies a Contradiction, the Doctrine of the Reſurrection would be very credible and certain too, whatever other Objections might be urged againſt it; which yet are not in themſelves ſo formidable as they may be imagined to be.</p>
                     <p>All the Objections againſt the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Dead are either againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Bodies after their Corruption and Diſſolution, or againſt the Reſurrection of the ſame Bodies of Men which they had before their Death, becauſe the parts of our Bodies are in a perpetual Change and Flux here, and after Death by ſeveral Accidents, as by the devouring of Humane Bodies by Men, or by Fiſh, or other Creatures, which are afterwards eaten by Men, it may come to paſs that the ſame parts which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded one Man's Body, ſhall afterwards belong to anothers, and yet in the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they can belong but to one of theſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. But,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Bodies after their Corruption and the Diſſolution of the Parts which compoſe them may be reſtored to Life by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union of theſe Parts again. We have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inſtances of this in Natural Philoſophy that Bodies divided into never ſo minute Parts, tho' theſe Parts be mix'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:61773:572"/>with the Parts of other Bodies, may by Chymical Operations be reduced to their former State and Condition, and which is of nearer affinity to the Subject in hand, after the Aſhes of a Plant have been ſown in a Garden fairer and larger Plants have ſprung up than had been known of that kind in the place where the Experiment was made.

                        </note> Learned Phyſician, that Nutrition is a ſupply of the Fluid Parts, and that the proper Subſtance of the Solid Parts ſuffers no Diminution, but in ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Caſes, and therefore can ſtand in no need of Reparation but in ſuch a Caſe. For <hi>the whole Body is Vaſcular,</hi> or made up of Veſſels and Pipes repleniſhed with their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Subſtances; ſo that in an <hi>Atrophy</hi> the Fibres become dry, and the Nerves and Veſſels are contracted, and ſhrunk for want of the Spirits and Juices and Liquors which before filled and diſtended them. But the Solid Parts are of ſo durable a Subſtance, that they can ſuffer no Diminution, but by ſuch Corroſives to diſſolve them, as muſt produce Ulcers, and ſuch as would affect the Fibres with ſo intolerable Pains, that <hi>the Torments of the Stone and Gout would be moderate and eaſie to them; which in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption would be Univerſal</hi> in all parts of the Body; whereas there is no ſuch Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom in any Part; and in the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions the Bones are found to retain their entire Bigneſs; tho' a piece of Bone is
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:61773:573"/>ſooner Diſſolved by a Corroſive Liquor, ſuch as <hi>Aqua-Fortis,</hi> than Muſcular Fibres of equal quantity or weight.</p>
                     <p>It is wont to be obſerv'd upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that when the Change of Parts is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, and in the courſe of ſome Years the Body may ſtill be the ſame, as it could not be, if the Change were made all at once. A Ship or Houſe remains the ſame tho' it be never ſo often repaired, and tho' the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials in Succeſſion of Time be all or moſt of them renewed: whereas if it ſhould be taken to pieces all at once, and all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials ſhould be changed, and new Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of the ſame Figure and Dimenſions ſhould be exactly in the ſame manner fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and built up together in their ſtead, theſe would make another Houſe or Ship, and not the ſame that was before.</p>
                     <p>But when the Parts which <hi>conſtitute</hi> the Humane Body, and give it the Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body of this or that individual Man continue the ſame, the ſame Perſon has the ſame Body in his Old Age, that he had in his Youth, as truly as he has the ſame Body in Sickneſs, which he had in Health; and the ſame under the Languiſhings of a Conſumption, which he had in his greateſt Vigour and Strength. For the Change is only in the variable and accidental Parts, which are not <hi>neceſſary</hi> to <hi>conſtitute</hi> the Body
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:61773:574"/>of ſuch a Man; and the <hi>neceſſary conſtituent Parts</hi> (tho' they were changed or altered, as in ſome very rare caſes they may be) being ſo few in Compariſon of the reſt, which make up the Bulk of a Man's Body, can hardly be ſuppoſed by the devouring of Canibals, or by any other Accident to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>conſtituent Parts</hi> of any other Man's Body.

                        <hi>Sanctorius</hi> from his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Experiments has Obſerved, that a very inconſiderable part of what we eat, is turned to Nouriſhment; and from the ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion which the <hi>Neceſſary conſtituent Parts</hi> bear to the reſt, and the unfitneſs of them, as of Bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to nouriſh, it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that little or nothing of that which turns to Nouriſhment, can be ſuppoſed to be of thoſe <hi>conſtituent Parts;</hi> and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further the great Changes which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in our Bodies in the continual Flux of Parts, and the ſmall Proportion again, which the <hi>conſtituent,</hi> or <hi>neceſſary eſſential Parts</hi> have to the reſt, we may conclude (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe parts as well as others to ſuffer Alteration) that it is the greateſt odds, that the <hi>conſtituent Parts</hi> which turn to Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do not by that Nouriſhment happen to belong to the <hi>conſtituent Parts</hi> of the Mans Body who is nouriſhed by them when he comes to die. So that if a Man ſhould live wholly upon Humane Fleſh, which it
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:61773:574"/>is not to be believed that ever any Man did, yet it would perhaps be above an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to one whether any <hi>conſtituent Part</hi> of his Body were made up when he died, of the <hi>conſtituent Parts</hi> of any other Man's Body. And beſides, it muſt be granted by all, that Believe a God and a Providence, that a particular Providence may take ſuch effectual care of us as to reſerve to every Man his own Body in all the <hi>Eſſential Parts of it; the Hairs of our Heads are all Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred;</hi> that is, they are as well known to God, as they could be to us, if we had told and numbred them never ſo exactly; and therefore much more the <hi>neceſſary Parts</hi> of us are under his Cognizance and Care.</p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>neceſſary conſtituent Parts</hi> then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, God may ſupply the reſt, as he ſhall ſee fitting; and the Body will be the ſame after the Reſurrection, that it was in this Life, tho' the Bodies of Men at the Reſurrection muſt ariſe in all the Perfection of an Humane Body, and therefore muſt have no part wanting: For if any part of an Humane Body ſhould be wanting, they would not have all the perfection of ſuch a Body, tho' they ſhould be never ſo perfect in all the parts which they be ſuppoſed to have. For if a Man having but one Eye, or one Ear, ſhould be able to ſee or hear
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:61773:575"/>with that one better than ever any Man did with two, yet it would ſtill be a defect in his Body to want an Eye, or an Ear.</p>
                     <p>All the uſes of any one part of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are not perhaps yet fully known, and the Dependance which one part has upon another may be ſuch, as that it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that thoſe parts ſhould be raiſed for their Relative uſefulneſs, which may ſeem to have no proper uſe of their own after the Reſurrection. The Sight is a Senſe which may be capable of Improvements beyond what we now are able to conceive, as we may conclude from the Improvements which have been made by the help of Microſcopes and Teleſcopes. And who knows, but that in the Glorified State our Eyes ſhall have that perfection, as to be able to diſcern the Contexture and Motions, and the whole Frame of thoſe pure, Spiritual and Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Bodies; and then thoſe parts, which now to the naked view, and much more when diſcerned thro' Microſcopes cauſe ſo much Admiration, will be ſtill much more admirable to behold, when they are tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly ſeen and fully underſtood by us; and to want thoſe parts which may ſeem to be then no longer of any uſe, would be to want one great Argument of our praiſe of God in the contemplation of his Wonderful Works.</p>
                     <p>But this is mentioned only to ſhew that
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:61773:575"/>an ordinary Fancy, if it be allowed to take the Liberty which ſome have done upon this Subject, might eaſily propoſe as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Reaſons in Defence of the Received Doctrines, as can be framed againſt them.
<note n="(o)" place="margin">Quaeſt. 53.</note> The Author of <hi>the Anſwers to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox</hi> amongſt the Works of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> ſays that ſome parts of our Bodies, tho' they will then have no direct uſefulneſs, yet will be raiſed at the laſt Day, to be Memorials to us of the Wiſdom of God in that uſe which we had of them in this Life. And
<note n="(p)" place="margin">Aug. <hi>Civit. Dei,</hi> lib. xxii. c. 17.</note> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays, that the Glory of God will be magnified, in that he will have freed thoſe Members from the Corruption to which they were ſubject here. However, it ought to ſuffice Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that our Bodies ſhall be like to Chriſt's Body, and therefore ſhall have the full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and proportion of all the parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting an Humane Body, as his Body had after his Reſurrection. <hi>We know that we ſhall be like him,</hi> 1 Joh. iii. 2. and as for any thing further it will be time enough to know it at the Reſurrection.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. It is not only Credible and Reaſonable to believe that God can, but likewiſe that he will Raiſe the Dead. The Revelation of his Will in his Holy Word ought to put this beyond Diſpute among Chriſtians. But beſides, it appears to be requiſite from the
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:61773:576"/>Nature of Man, conſiſting of Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that there ſhould be a Reſurrection of the Body; it is fit that the Man ſhould be puniſhed that Sinned, and that the Man who lived well here, and ſuffered for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake, ſhould be rewarded for it. But if the Soul only be Puniſhed, or the Soul only be Rewarded, the Man is not rewarded or Puniſhed; for the Soul is but part of the Man, but Soul and Body together make up the whole Man, and therefore it is requiſite that the Soul and Body ſhould be re-united. <hi>For we muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his Body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad,</hi> 2 Cor. v. 10. For this Reaſon it is requiſite that the Soul ſhould be again united to the ſame Body; otherwiſe the Soul and Body would conſtitute a Man, but not the ſame Man that was before, the Body not being the ſame; for it muſt be the ſame Soul and the ſame Body that make the ſame Man. <hi>As in Adam all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive,</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 22. the ſame Body therefore that died in <hi>Adam</hi> is to be made alive in Chriſt; <hi>who ſhall change our vile Body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious Body, according to the working, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is able even to ſubdue all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> Philip. iii. 21. Chriſt himſelf roſe
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:61773:576"/>with the ſame Body that was Crucified, and we are to be like him at the Reſurrection, and to have our Bodies Changed into the likeneſs of his Glorious Body. And indeed, if a New Body were aſſumed how could it be a Reſurrection? Which implies the Riſing again of that Body, which after the Separation of the Soul was Buried in the Grave; and otherwiſe, as it is uſually argued, one Body may be puniſhed for the Sins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in another.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid that the Body is only the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Senſation to the Soul, but is it ſelf capable of none, and therefore muſt be uncapable of Rewards or Puniſhments. It may perhaps be Anſwered, that this is more than can be abſolutely concluded from the Notions of Modern Philoſophy againſt the General Senſe of Mankind, and the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy of all former Ages. However, the Body being unable to determine it ſelf in its Senſations, if it have any of its own. I confeſs I cannot think this Argument fit to be inſiſted upon, in as much as no Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can be capable of Rewards or Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but ſuch as proceed from choice.</p>
                     <p>But it muſt be acknowledged, that the the Soul may be capable of more Happineſs or Miſery, when re-united to the Body, than in its Separate State. For beſides the Anguiſh, or the Peace and Joy of Mind, beſides its own Reflections, and its proper
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:61773:577"/>Operations, which the Soul is capable of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> State of Separation from the Body; it is capable of being affected with Senſations, which ariſe from its Union with the Body. And that theſe may be anſwerable to what a Man's Actions in this Life have been, the Soul muſt be United to the ſelf ſame Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo diſpoſed and qualified to affect the Soul as it was in this Life, only with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely greater, more exquiſite and more laſting Degree of Pain or of Joy and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; yet without any mixture of groſs and ſenſual Pleaſures in the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but only ſuch as are ſuitable to Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bodies. And this Diſpoſition of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy depends upon the Vertuous or Vicious Actions and Habits of Men here; for a Body by Vicious Practices and Cuſtoms prone to raging and furious Paſſions, inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable Appetites, and tormenting Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Deſires (without any thing to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie or aſſwage them) muſt have quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effect upon a Soul, than a Body ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued to the mild and calm and obedient Temper of Religion and Vertue. And tho' God could by his Almighty power form another Body to that Frame and Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the Body of any particular Man was in, when his Soul departed out of it; yet it doth not ſeem agreeable to the Divine Goodneſs and purity, by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:61773:577"/>power to frame a New Body to the depraved Temper and Inclinations of a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Man. And we are ſo little acquainted with the Union of the Soul and Body, that for ought we know, a Soul can be United only to its proper Body. The Truth is, we know nothing of theſe Matters, but from the Scriptures, all beſides is only Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. But the Doctrine of the Scriptures is probable even to our Reaſon, tho' indeed it ought to over-rule Reaſon, eſpecially in things which are ſo obſcure, and ſo little underſtood by us. God has declared that he will raiſe theſe Bodies to Life again at the Day of Judgment; and whatever we may think of it, to him all things are alike eaſie, it is as eaſie for him to do, as to ſay it.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>ST. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt's Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſays, <hi>him God raiſed up the third Day, and ſhewed him openly, not to all the People, but unto Witneſſes choſen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him, after he roſe from the Dead,</hi> Acts x. 40, 41. After his Reſurrection he was ſhewn openly, but not to all the People; he was ſeen in a plain and open manner, yet not ſo publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as to make all the People Witneſſes of his Reſurrection. The Will and good Pleaſure of God is a ſufficient Reaſon to us of all his Actions, eſpecially in Acts of Mercy: For it would be a ſtrange Return made but to a <hi>Man</hi> for any Favour received, to be capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and quarrelſome about the manner of his beſtowing it, inſtead of being grateful to him for it. But beſides this General Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which ought to be of Force with us in all Caſes, there are Reaſons peculiar to the preſent Caſe, whereby we may be able to give an Account of it, even according to our own Apprehenſions of things.</p>
                     <pb n="449" facs="tcp:61773:578"/>
                     <p n="1">I. There are Reaſons peculiar to this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation of Chriſt's Reſurrection; why Chriſt ſhould not ſhew himſelf to all the People, after he was riſen from the dead.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. It had not been ſuitable to the other Diſpenſations of God towards. Mankind for him to do it.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Great Numbers of the <hi>Jews</hi> were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over to hardneſs of heart, and would not have believed, tho' they had ſeen Chriſt after his Reſurrection.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. If they had Believed, their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had not been a greater proof of the Truth of his Reſurrection, than their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief has been.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. The Power of his Reſurrection mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the Miraculous Gifts beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Apoſtles was as great a Proof of his Reſurrection, as the Perſonal Appearance of our Saviour himſelf could have been.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There are Reaſons peculiar to this Diſpenſation of his Reſurrection, why Chriſt ſhould not ſhew himſelf to all the People after he was riſen from the Dead. Chriſt after his Reſurrection was to act according to the Majeſty of the Divine Nature, not according to the Infirmities and Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Humane; the time of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with Men was at an end at his Death, and then another method and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Diſpenſation was to begin; he was then to Converſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>only with his particular

It could not be ſuitable to the Dignity of his Majeſty, which he had aſſumed after his Reſurrection, to ſubmit himſelf to the Cenſures of his Enemies; he had ſuffered enough from them already in the State of his Humiliation, and muſt he never be above the Suſpicion and Scrutiny of their Malice? Shall not his Reſurrection free him from it? When they ſaw him hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Croſs, they cried out with up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding and inſolent Scorn, that they would believe in him, if he would come down from thence; but neither did they deſerve ſuch a Miracle to be wrought at their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, who thus called for it, nor was it ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Divine Diſpenſation that it ſhould be wrought. It was neither fitting that he ſhould ſave himſelf from Death, nor that he ſhould appear to them after he was riſen from the Dead. He was to Die for our Redemption, and as we had wanted the Argument from his Reſurrection for the Truth of our Religion, if he had come down from the Croſs; ſo if he had appeared to all the <hi>Jews,</hi> we had wanted other Evidence; which, as I ſhall ſhew, at leaſt amounts to all the Proof which that could have given.</p>
                     <p>In the State of his Humiliation our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was pleaſed to ſuffer himſelf to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:61773:581"/>to <hi>the contradiction of Sinners,</hi> and to all their Affronts and Injuries; but when <hi>this their Hour and the Power of Darkneſs</hi> was once paſt, they were to ſee him no more, but with confuſion of Face and terrour of Mind; yet his Mercy was ſtill the ſame towards them; one of the greateſt Perſecutors was converted by a Voice from Heaven, the Son of Man ſpeaking to him from thence, that he might be the happy Inſtrument in the Converſion of others, and a <hi>Pattern</hi> to them of the <hi>long ſuffering</hi> of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 16. But his manifeſtation of himſelf to St. <hi>Paul</hi> at his Converſion was with dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Awe and Majeſty, not in that mild and gracious Glory, in which he was ſeen by St. <hi>Stephen;</hi> and it is reſerved for thoſe who perſecuted and <hi>pierced him,</hi> to look upon him with Conſternation and Anguiſh at the Laſt Day, <hi>Rev.</hi> i. 7.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It had not been ſuitable to the other Diſpenſations of God towards Mankind for Chriſt to be ſhown openly to all the People. God might work ſuch aſtoniſhing Miracles, and ſtrike ſuch Terrors into the Minds of Men, as to make it impoſſible for any one to doubt of his Exiſtence, or of the Truth of his Word; but he doth not all which he can do, but what he in his Wiſdom ſees fit to be done; he doth not uſe all the Means which ſome Men may conceit he might uſe, but leaves Men without excuſe, and then
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:61773:582"/>requires their Faith and Obedience at their peril. To imagine that Chriſt ſhould have appeared promiſcuouſly unto all, is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, as to ſuppoſe that God ſhould communicate himſelf to all alike, or that he ſhould have ſpoken from Heaven to Men without the Meſſage and Miniſtry of his Prophets. For when Chriſt was riſen from the Dead, he was no longer to act like a Mortal Man, but as in his Glorified State as our Lord and King, and as God in our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, now no longer ſubject to any of its Imperfections; and therefore he was no more to come himſelf to the People, as he had done in the State of his Humiliation, but to ſend his Apoſtles and Diſciples among them, as he had before his Incarnation ſent the Prophets.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Great Numbers of the <hi>Jews</hi> were given up to hardneſs of heart, and would not have believed, tho' they had ſeen Chriſt after his Reſurrection. Thoſe, who when they had ſeen our Saviour's Miracles, had vilified them, and blaſphemed the Holy Ghoſt, by whom they were wrought, had their hearts hardned, that <hi>ſeeing they might ſee and not perceive, and be converted.</hi> And of this Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Chief Prieſts and Elders muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be, who hired the Soliders to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict and Stifle the Belief of his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with a falſe Story of their own Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Chief Prieſts before had Conſulted
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:61773:582"/>to put <hi>Lazarus</hi> to Death, when he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably known to have been raiſed from the Grave, <hi>John</hi> xii. 10. So far were they from being brought to a Belief in Chriſt by the ſight of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that they fully verified that Saying, that there are ſome, who <hi>will not believe, tho one roſe from the Dead. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> was ſhewn openly to all the People, and lived among them for many years after he had been reſtored to Life again, when he had been Dead four Days; and they would not believe, tho' they ſaw and converſed with him, but were the more enraged at it; Chriſt himſelf therefore after his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction did not vouchſafe them his preſence, but uſed other means which were more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If the <hi>Jews</hi> had believed in Chriſt, their Converſion had not been a greater Proof of the Truth of his Reſurrection, than their Unbelief has been. Their ſtubbornneſs and hardneſs of heart was foretold by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, with their Diſperſion, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and the Propagation of the Goſpel (according to the Prediction likewiſe of the Prophets) in ſo Miraculous a manner, not only at a diſtance, but in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> and in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> itſelf, notwithſtanding all the Oppoſition which the <hi>Jews</hi> could make, gave as great a Teſtimony to it, as their Favour and Protection could have done. And therefore it was juſt with God rather to
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:61773:583"/>leave them to the hardneſs of their own hearts, than to uſe ſuch further Methods with them as were unſuitable to the Divine Diſpenſation in the Myſtery of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and would either have only hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them to a greater Degree, or at leaſt would not have proved more effectual to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Manifeſtation of the Truth of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Power of Chriſt's Reſurrection manifeſted in the Miraculous Gifts beſtowed upon the Apoſtles, was as great a proof of his Reſurrection, as the Perſonal Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our Saviour himſelf could have been. Our Saviour ſhewed himſelf to <hi>Witneſſes cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen before of God, to be Witneſſes of all things which he did both in the Land of the Jews and in Jeruſalem,</hi> Acts x. 39, 41. theſe Men knew his Life and Doctrine, they had been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by him, and had forſaken all for him, and according to his Promiſe were <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with Power from on high,</hi> to enable them to teſtifie to the whole World, that they had not only ſeen him, but had often Converſed with him after he roſe from the Dead. And one of their Chief Qualifications was, that they were but a few, poor and ignorant Men without Force or Policy, without any Art or Contrivance; they could tell a plain Truth, but could neither feign nor diſſemble; if they had been more in Number, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the World had been ſo much the
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:61773:583"/>leſs Miraculous; and they were not choſen out of the Scribes and Elders who had been uſed to Artifices and Falſhood, but had them all along their Enemies, and oppoſed to their Craft and Power an honeſt ſimplicity of Mind, that neither knew what belonged to Deceit, nor feared any in ſo good a Cauſe; nor were they in the leaſt diſcouraged to ſee their own and all other Nations againſt them. <hi>God had choſen the Fooliſh things of the World to confound the Wiſe; and God had choſen the weak things of the World to confound the things which are mighty,</hi> 1 Cor. i. 27.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Men under all Neceſſities, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, and Dangers, and Torments, both Living and Dying Witneſſed that they had ſeen Chriſt alive after he had been Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and tho' they were but very few in Compariſon of their Enemies, yet conſidered as Witneſſes they were many; for <hi>he was ſeen by above five hundred at once,</hi> which is a vaſt number in any matter of Evidence; and if ſo many Men be not a ſufficient Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, no number of Men could have been. That which is demonſtrated but in one way, is as certain as if it were demonſtrable in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many Methods; and he who ſees a thing plainly with his two Eyes, may be as ſure of it, as if he had never ſo many Eyes to ſee it withal. <hi>It is written in the Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes, that the Teſtimony of two Men is true,</hi> or Credible, and to be relied upon for Truth,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:61773:584"/>
                        <hi>John</hi> viii. 17. and it is the Law and Practice of all Nations to content themſelves with a ſmall number of ſufficient Witneſſes in proof of the moſt important Affairs. And if theſe <hi>Witneſſes choſen before of God</hi> ſpoke, and acted, and ſuffered, as no Men would or could have done, if they had not been well aſſured of what they teſtified, and aſſiſted from above in preaching the Goſpel; the Truth of the Reſurrection of Chriſt is as infallibly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to us by their Teſtimony, as it could have been by the Teſtimony of never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more: for all that never ſo many others could have done, would have been but the ſame thing over again, which theſe Men cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by <hi>many infallible Proofs;</hi> and what is once infallibly proved, is as certain as if all the World ſhould agree in declaring it. It is not the number of Witneſſes, but the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and Qualifications of the Perſons, and the Evidence it ſelf in its full force and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which are chiefly to be regarded in Matters of this Nature. If but a few Men can make it ſufficiently appear, as the Apoſtles did, by undeniable Miracles, that what they ſay is true, and that God himſelf confirms the Truth of it, they then appeal to every Man's own Senſes, before whom they work their Miracles, and make every one that ſees them a Witneſs to the Truth of their Doctrine; God himſelf bears Witneſs to it, and the <hi>Jews</hi> might have ſaid in this,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:61773:584"/>as they did in a very different Caſe, <hi>What need we any further Witneſſes? for we our ſelves have heard of their own mouths,</hi> in the Miraculous Gift of Tongues, or ſeen it with our own Eyes, in the many wonderful Works which were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually wrought in the moſt publick manner, in Teſtimony of the Reſurrection of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour therefore gave as full proof of his Reſurrection, as if he had appear'd in the Temple, or in the midſt of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to the whole People of the <hi>Jews.</hi> For this had not been more effectual to the Converſion of moſt of them, nor more ſufficient to evidence the Truth of the Goſpel, than his Appearance to his Diſciples was; and if the <hi>Jews</hi> had una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly believed, it could not have contributed more to convince Men of the Truth of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, than their Unbelief has done; he ſent his Apoſtles with a Miraculous Power, as convincing as his own Appearance could have been; and all things conſidered, the <hi>Jews</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us as full Evidence in behalf of the Goſpel by oppoſing it, as they could have done by their compliance with it. And ſince we have ſufficient Teſtimony to reſolve our Faith into the Divine Veracity, the certainty is the ſame, whether the Witneſſes be more or fewer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it depends upon the veracity of God, which is always the ſame, whatever the means be, by which our Faith is reſolved into it.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXVII. <hi>Of the Forty Days in which Chriſt remain'd upon Earth after his Reſurrection, and of the manner of his Aſcenſion.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>OUR Bleſſed Saviour had certified his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of his Reſurrection in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as to give them <hi>many infallible Proofs</hi> of it, or elſe it is impoſſible for any thing to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly proved; and that which is chiefly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in this matter is, that he was ſeen by them not once but often, not for a ſhort time, or at a haſty Interview, but for <hi>forty days</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then he performed the common Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Humane Life, <hi>he did eat and drink with them,</hi> and diſcourſed with them of the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to his Kingdom. <hi>To whom alſo he ſhewed himſelf alive after his Paſſion by many infallible proofs, being ſeen of them forty days, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.</hi> Acts i. 3. That which I here deſign is, to make ſome Obſervations upon the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation that our Saviour had with his Diſciples, during the Forty days between his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and his Aſcenſion, and upon the manner of his leaving them, when he aſcended into Heaven.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Scriptures acquaint us that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was ſeen of his Diſciples Forty Days, or that he vouchſafed them his preſence the
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:61773:585"/>greateſt part of that time which he remained upon Earth after his Reſurrection. But in what manner all that time was ſpent with them, we are no where told; which is no wonder, if we conſider how much of his former Life is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from us.</p>
                     <p>In the Scriptures, which are written for our Inſtruction, and in the plaineſt and ſincereſt manner in the World to inform us of all things neceſſary to our Salvation, we have nothing taken notice of, for Oſtentation nor for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but many things omitted in the Life of Chriſt, which are thought needful in Humane Authors, to make up a compleat Hiſtory. We have no more mentioned of his Parentage than was neceſſary to make it evident that he was deſcended from <hi>David,</hi> and born of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, as the Prophets had foretold of him. When he was born, we read that the Shepherds and the Wiſe-Men came to Worſhip him; that he was Circumciſed, that he was brought to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be preſented to the Lord, and that he was carried into <hi>Aegypt</hi> to avoid <hi>Herod</hi>'s Cruelty, and hereby known Prophecies were fulfilled. Afterwards he was brought to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth</hi> upon the death of <hi>Herod,</hi> and from that time we read no more of him 'till the twelfth Year of his Age, when he Diſputed with the Doctors in the Temple. And then we are told that he went down to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his Mother, and to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Terms, that he <hi>encreaſed in Wiſdom and
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:61773:586"/>Stature, and in favour with God and Man;</hi> as it was before ſaid of him, that he <hi>grew and waxed ſtrong in Spirit, filled with Wiſdom, and the grace of God was upon him,</hi> Luke ii. 40, 52. The next time we read any thing of him, is when he was about Thirty years of Age, and came to <hi>John</hi> to be Baptized.</p>
                     <p>Thus not only during his Infancy and Childhood there is little related of our Bleſſed Saviour, but his riper years are paſſed over in Silence; in all which time we may be ſure that there was no Speech or Action of ſo Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine a Perſon, but what well deſerved the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of all that knew him, and was more worthy of mention in Hiſtory, than all the Renowned Adventures and Exploits, or than the Wiſe or Witty Sayings which adorn the Lives of the Greateſt among the Sons of Men. But Modeſty, Humility, and a Contempt of the praiſe of Men were ſome of the great and uſeful Doctrines in which he came to inſtruct Mankind; and he could not do this more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually than by his own Example, in leading a mean and obſcure Life, little known or taken notice of in the World, 'till two or three years before he was to leave it by a Cruel and Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Death. He did not chuſe to ſpend his time in places of publick Reſort and Converſe; and when he Diſputed in the Temple, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the particulars is mentioned. This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and unknown Perſon was to rebuke and comptroll the Pride and Vanity of the Popular Scribes and Phariſees.</p>
                     <pb n="461" facs="tcp:61773:586"/>
                     <p>And after he had appeared in the World, very much of his Life was ſpent in privacy and retirement; not many of his Diſcourſes are delivered down to us, and the greateſt part of his Actions are omitted. For if they had been all written and deſcribed in their ſeveral Circumſtances, many Volumes muſt have been taken up in the Narrative of them; inſomuch that St. <hi>John ſuppoſes that even the World itſelf could not have contained the Books that ſhould have been written,</hi> Joh. xxi. 25. that is, as we might expreſs it in our Language, he did a world of things more than theſe, which are related of him; and in the ſame ſenſe of the Word, St. <hi>James</hi> ſays, that the Tongue is <hi>a world of Iniquity,</hi> Jam. iii. 6. The meaning of St. <hi>John</hi> is, that hardly any words could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs how many other things were done by our Saviour, beſides thoſe which he had ſet down. Chriſt might have employed ſome accurate Hiſtorian to compoſe the Annals of his whole Life with the greateſt exactneſs imaginable; but he was pleaſed to be repreſented to the World very imperfeſtly by ſuch as knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what belonged to the writing Hiſtory any farther than to be able to tell the ſtrict and neceſſary Truth. The Evangeliſts wrote his Life with the ſame Humility with which he lived.</p>
                     <p>And it is obſervable, that when St. <hi>John</hi> ſays that there were ſo <hi>many other things which Jeſus did,</hi> he ſpeaks with relation to the things
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:61773:587"/>done by him after his Reſurrection, having juſt before given an account of what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had ſaid to St. <hi>Peter.</hi> And ſo in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter, when St. <hi>John</hi> has declared how our Saviour certified St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of the Truth of his Reſurrection, he adds, <hi>and many other Signs truly did Jeſus in the preſence of his Diſciples, which are not written in this Book, but theſe are written, that ye might believe, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ye might have Life through his Name,</hi> Joh. xx. 30, 31. So that we are acquainted with no more than was neceſſary, of what paſs'd between our Saviour and his Diſciples after his Reſurrection, the reſt concerns us not to know; it was for their Inſtruction and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement in their Duty, and they were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd to teach and inſtruct us. We know that <hi>beginning at Moſes and all the Prophets he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himſelf,</hi> Luke xxiv. 27. but we are no where told what were the Particulars of his Expoſition; only we are ſure that the Apoſtles in their Explications of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament followed the Interpretations which he had given. We read that he was <hi>ſeen of them forty days, and ſpoke of the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God?</hi> from whence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the time between the Reſurrection and the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, was chiefly ſpent in comforting and inſtructing them, and in expounding to them the Scriptures concerning
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:61773:587"/>his Paſſion and Reſurrection, and the coming of the Holy Ghoſt after his Aſcenſion.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> mentions, that <hi>he was ſeen by above five hundred Brethren at once, of whom the greater part</hi> were then ſtill alive to teſtifie the Truth of what he ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 6. tho' this Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, however remarkable, is omitted by the Evangeliſts; for they relate things juſt as they ſaw it needful upon every Occaſion, and ſince they ſaid enough to convince Men, they were not careful to ſay all that might be ſaid, they were ready to die in Teſtimony of what they delivered, and daily wrought Miracles to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it; and therefore were not ſollicitous to lay together all the Particulars, or to put them into any exact Order and Method; they declared what they knew, and their Miracles proved it, and they depended not upon ſuch Niceties as Humane Proofs have need of.</p>
                     <p>We may reaſonably conclude then, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſilence of the Sacred Writers, that when Chriſt had once fully manifeſted himſelf to his Diſciples, and ſatisfied them in his Reſurrection, the reſt of the time till his Aſcenſion was moſt of it ſpent with them in Divine Diſcourſes for their Inſtruction and Comfort; ſuch as thoſe are which we read in the Evangeliſts, one of whom declares that a full account of all that paſs'd between him and his Diſciples was more than could well be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd. That happy time was employ'd in pure and Spiritual Joys and Contemplations,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:61773:588"/>in forming and preparing them for the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> knew our Lord after his Reſurrection, ſhe fell at his feet to Worſhip him, and would touch his Sacred Body, <hi>Matt.</hi> xxviii. 9. <hi>Joh.</hi> xx. 17. For this Reaſon perhaps too, as well as out of Devotion to him, that ſhe might be able to give the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles the better account of his being riſen again. But he forbad her, ſaying, <hi>touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended to my Father,</hi> and then ſends her to his Diſciples, to his <hi>Brethren,</hi> as he with infinite Love and Condeſcenſion ſtyles them. He was not yet aſcended, or was not then about to aſcend, but to ſtay many days upon Earth, and there would be time enough for her nearer approaches to him; either for the encreaſe and confirmation of her Faith, or for her Acknowledgment and Adoration. After his Reſurrection Chriſt made himſelf known to his Diſciples by degrees, and by ſeveral Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances to them at diſtant times, in divers Places, and in different manners; he ſuffered them to doubt of that great Article of our Faith for a while, that he might overcome their Unbelief, and extort a Conviction from them by ſuch means, as that no Man unleſs he would be very unreaſonable and obſtinate, ſhould pretend any Cauſe to doubt of it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. But when he had thoroughly convinc'd them of his Reſurrection, we may conclude from what we read of his Converſing with
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:61773:588"/>them, that from that time he admitted them to a freer and more intimate Communication with himſelf, and Diſcourſed with them in the moſt mild and gracious and inſtructive manner of all which it concerned them to know per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to his Kingdom, or which they were capable then of knowing, before the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt; ſometimes perhaps vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing his Preſence to one, and ſometimes to others of them, and moſt commonly to them altogether, when they were aſſembled, as we find they generally were. And when he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelf, it was becauſe their Mortal State would not bear a conſtant and uninterrupted Attendance for ſo long a time upon their Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Maſter; and becauſe it was requiſite that they by degrees ſhould be accuſtomed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure his Abſence, and to <hi>walk by Faith, not by Sight;</hi> and after his Aſcenſion, the Holy Ghoſt the Comforter did not immediately come upon his Departure from them, but their Faith was to be exerciſed in the expectation of him for the ſpace of Ten Days, and then his Promiſe was to be fulfilled in the fitteſt and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Seaſon, on the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In few words, Chriſt <hi>was ſeen of them,</hi> ſays the Scripture, <hi>forty Days;</hi> which implies that theſe for the moſt part were ſpent in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and we are in the ſame place told how this time was employ'd, in <hi>ſpeaking of the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. We may obſerve the manner how our Saviour left his Diſciples, when he aſcended up
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:61773:589"/>from them into Heaven. He had before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared them to expect his Aſcenſion; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what he had ſaid to them before his death, immediately upon his Reſurrection he ſent this Meſſage to his Diſciples by <hi>Mary Magdalen, Go to my Brethren, and ſay unto them, I aſcend unto my Father, and your Father, and to my God, and your God,</hi> Joh. xx. 17. They were in hopes, it ſeems, that he would <hi>at this time have reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red again the Kingdom to Iſrael,</hi> and did not think he would have left them, before that, which they ſo much deſired had been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. However, taking his Leave of them, <hi>he commanded them that they ſhould not depart from Jeruſalem, but wait for the Promiſe of the Father, which ſays he ye have heard of me.</hi> And whilſt he was giving them repeated Aſſurances that this Promiſe ſhould be moſt effectually fulfilled, <hi>while they beheld, he was taken up, and a Cloud received him out of their ſight;</hi> he was not ſnatch'd away from them by a ſwift and violent motion, like <hi>Elijah,</hi> and carried up in a fiery Chariot, which might dazle their ſight, that they could not diſcern him in his Aſcent, but he was lifted up and removed from them leiſurely, and by degrees, <hi>they looked ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly towards Heaven as he went up,</hi> by a viſible and eaſie motion, and they had a clear view of him, 'till at laſt <hi>a Cloud received him out of their ſight.</hi> It is probable that all the Diſciples to the Number of <hi>about an hundred and twenty,</hi> mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> i. 15. were preſent to behold the Aſcent of our Saviour.
<note n="(q)" place="margin">Apud <hi>Euſeb.</hi> Hiſt. lib. 1. c. ult.</note> The Apoſtle
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:61773:589"/>St. <hi>Thaddeus</hi> declared, tho' this (as well as many other things) is not inſerted into the Scriptures, that a great multitude of the Saints and Heavenly Hoſt went up with him; we read of the Appearance of two Angels upon this Occaſion, who acquainted the Diſciples, <hi>that this ſame Jeſus</hi> whom they had thus evidently ſeen <hi>taken up from them into Heaven, ſhould ſo come in like manner, as they had ſeen him go into Heaven.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> informs us that the manner of his Coming at the laſt Day will be <hi>with his mighty Angels,</hi> or the Angels of his Power, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> i. 7. From whence we may conclude, according to the Account of St. <hi>Thad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deus,</hi> that the Holy Angels viſibly attended him in his Aſcenſion.</p>
                     <p>The Diſciples were all much ſurprized at a thing ſo wonderful, and <hi>ſtood gazing up into Heaven</hi> after him, 'till they were certified not only by their own Senſes, but by the Meſſage of the Angels that he was gone from them into Heaven, no more to be expected from thence, till the Day of Judgment.</p>
                     <p>We have therefore the plaineſt and fulleſt Evidence that can be deſired, both of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Aſcenſion of our Saviour. <hi>He ſhewed himſelf alive</hi> to his Diſciples <hi>after his Paſſion by many infallible Proofs,</hi> he was <hi>ſeen of them forty days,</hi> and Converſed and Diſcourſed with them, tho' we are not told after what manner, and by what Intervals of time he was pleaſed to vouchſafe them his Preſence; this being concealed from us, as very many of the
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:61773:590"/>Particulars are of his former Life before his Crucifixion. But at the end of the ſpace of <hi>forty days,</hi> whilſt he was in the midſt of them, he aſcended into Heaven in the ſight of them all, in ſuch a manner, that they diſtinctly ſaw and beheld him, and kept their Eyes fix'd upon him in his Aſcenſion, and a Viſion of Angels beſides informed them, that he is to return in the like manner, when he ſhall come to Judge the World.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXVIII. <hi>Why ſome Works of Nature are more eſpecially aſcribed to God; why Means was ſometimes uſed in the working of Miracles, and why Faith was ſometimes required of thoſe, upon whom, or before whom Miracles were wrought.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p n="1">I. ALL the Powers of Natural Cauſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from God, <hi>that</hi> may juſtly be aſcribed to him, <hi>which</hi> is wrought by them, for he works as truly by Second Cauſes, as by his own direct and immediate Power, in producing any Effect. The Order and Frame of Nature was Originally by his Appointment, and by his Care and Providence and Influence it is upheld; and therefore the Scriptures aſcribe the effects of Natural Agents to God as the Author of them; becauſe theſe can do nothing but by his Support and Influence, and the continuance and preſervation of Natural Cauſes in the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their Effects for ſo many Ages in one
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:61773:590"/>conſtant Tenour is a manifeſt and wonderful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Divine Power and Wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>But thoſe things may be ſaid more eſpecially to be done by God himſelf, whereby upon ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Occaſion his Power and his Will are more particularly manifeſted, or his Promiſe is fulfilled; for in thoſe things his Care and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is more concerned to bring them to paſs; and therefore God may employ a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary concourſe to ſuſtain and influence the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Nature that they may not ſail in ſuch Caſes to produce their Effects according to their uſual and ſetled Courſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Miracles are more peculiarly the Works of God, becauſe they are wrought without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence or ſubſerviency of Natural Means. For tho' ſometimes outward Means were uſed in the Miraculous Curing of Diſeaſes, yet they were ſuch as could have no effect in the Cure, but rather the contrary; as when the Man that was born blind, recovered his Sight by waſhing in the Pool of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loam</hi> at our Saviour's Command, after his Eyes had been anointed with Clay made of Duſt and Spittle. The Ointment made of Duſt and Spittle was ſo far from having any effect towards the Cure, that it would have been much more likely to have put out the eyes of a Man that had ſeen; and the waſhing afterwards could only remove that which was ſo far from being a Remedy, that it muſt have been an obſtruction to the beſt ſight.</p>
                     <p>As many Miraculous Cures were wrought by our Saviour without any more than a word ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſometimes even without ſo much as that,
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:61773:591"/>to ſhew that he had no need of Means; ſo when any Means were uſed, they were ſuch as apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could not tend to the Cure, and were not uſed as Remedies, but as Circumſtances, in the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Miracles to raiſe the Attention of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, to imprint what was done the deeper up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Memories, and to give the greater Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility to the Hiſtory of his Miracles. For all matter of Fact is to be proved or diſproved by Circumſtances; and the more Circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr in any Action, the leſs liable it is to Miſtake or Impoſture. Our Saviour therefore was pleas'd that his Miracles ſhould always be accompanied with remarkable Circumſtances, which were ſometimes of one kind, and ſometimes of another, the better to work upon the variety of Mens Tempers and Diſpoſitions; but whatever outward Means was at any time uſed by him, it could have the Nature only of a Circumſtance, and was no more proper and effectual to produce the Miracle than any other might have been. Some he touched, ſome he only ſpoke to, and others he ſent to the High-Prieſt, that he might be a Witneſs of the Cure. Now the touch, the ſpeaking, or the ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing could have no effect as outward Means, but only as they were attended with an inward and Divine efficacy. But all theſe were conſiderable Circumſtances to excite the Obſervation of thoſe who were preſent at theſe Cures, and to preſerve the Remembrance of them to Poſterity.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Tho' our Saviour had the moſt abſolute and unconfined Power of working Miracles at all times, and before all Perſons, whenſoever he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:61773:591"/>yet we may obſerve that he ſometimes refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to exerciſe it. For tho' he could always do his Marvellous Works, yet it was not fit that they ſhould be always done, but then only when they might be uſeful and ſerviceable to the Ends for which they were wrought, and to his Deſign of coming into the World, to manifeſt himſelf by working them. And that this was the Reaſon why our Saviour did ſometimes require Faith as a Qualification in them who came to be healed, and at other times refuſed to work his Miracles before Unbelievers, will be evident, if we conſider, that</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Chriſt had given undeniable proof of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Power in many Inſtances, before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Faith, as a Condition in ſuch as came to him to ſee his Miracles, and to receive the benefit of them. When the <hi>Jews</hi> demanded a Sign of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> ii. 18. he had wrought before them the greateſt of all his Miracles, in St.
<note n="(r)" place="margin">Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. in <hi>Matt.</hi> xxi, 15.</note> 
                        <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>'s Judgment, by caſting the Buyers and Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers out of the Temple. But they were ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable as upon this very account to ask for another Miracle: <hi>what Sign ſheweſt thou unto us, ſeeing that thou doeſt theſe things?</hi> Whereupon our Saviour ſignifies to them that he would riſe again from the Dead; and this was no refuſal, but only a ſhort delay of his working other Miracles; for at that very <hi>Paſsover when he was in Jeruſalem in the Feaſt-day many believed in his Name, when they ſaw the Miracles which he did.</hi> And then the firſt time we find Faith required as a Diſpoſition or Preparation in Men to have Miracles wrought for their Cure, or their Conviction, is <hi>Matt.</hi> xiii. 58.
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:61773:592"/>
                        <hi>Mark</hi> vi. 5. beſides the rejecting of the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Matt.</hi> xii. 38. And before the time to which theſe Texts have Relation, Chriſt had Cured <hi>all manner of Diſeaſes,</hi> and caſt out many <hi>Devils, and his Fame was ſpread abroad throughout all the Region round about Galilee,</hi> and even <hi>through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Syria,</hi> Matt. iv. 23, 24. Mark i. 28. He had Cured the <hi>Centurion</hi>'s Servant at a diſtance, and had reſtored to Life the Daughter of <hi>Jairus</hi> a Ruler of the Synagogue. Where it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that he commended the Faith of the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion,</hi> tho' the Cure was wrought upon his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; that he Exhorted the Father not to be <hi>afraid,</hi> but to <hi>believe,</hi> when his Fear or Faith could have no influence upon his dead Daughter. He had caſt out a Legion of Devils at once, and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to enter into the Herd of Swine, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince even the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> if any thing could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them, that they were Evil Spirits which he had caſt out, <hi>Mat.</hi> viii. 13. <hi>Mark</hi> v. 9, 22. And when our Saviour's Miraculous Power had thus manifeſted it ſelf upon all ſorts of Perſons, upon the Abſent, upon the Dead, and upon others, who could neither hope for, nor deſire relief of him, and this in the ſight of many who were ſtill Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and of ſome who charged him with caſting out Devils by <hi>Beelzebub, Matt.</hi> xii. 24. <hi>Luke</hi> xi. 15. it was highly reaſonable, that he ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards require a Belief of what he had already done, and was again able to do, before he would extend his Healing Power towards Men, and that he ſhould work no new Miracles for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of ſuch as diſregarded and disbelieved all that he had done before.</p>
                     <pb n="481" facs="tcp:61773:592"/>
                     <p>It doth not appear, that Chriſt ever requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Faith of any before his working of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, who had not already ſeen him work Miracles, unleſs it were of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, and of ſome who came to be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. His Country-Men by their Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at his Doctrin and his mighty Works, ſeem to ſhew that they had no Experience of them before, but that they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known at leaſt to the generality of them, any otherwiſe than by Report; but there was a peculiar Caſe, as I ſhall preſently prove. Thoſe who came to him with no cavilling deſign, but with a deſire and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of help from him, cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to doubt of his Power to do that for them, which they had ſeen him do for others; but many applied themſelves to him upon the common Report and Fame of his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Works, and it was requiſite that theſe ſhould believe what they had heard ſo well atteſted, if they would receive that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which they beſought of him. But as to others, it cannot be proved that Chriſt did ever, in order to his working a Miracle, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Faith of them, who had never ſeen him work any Miracle before, though, if he had done it, there might have been ſufficient Reaſon for it. But all beſides, in whom the want of Faith is at any time alleged as the Cauſe, why they had no Miracle wrought upon their Account in order to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:61773:593"/>had in all probability ſeen Miracles wrought by him before, which they would not believe, and that was Reaſon enough, why no more ſhould be wrought for them, to be deſpiſed, as the former had been: Or however our Saviour's Miracles were ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and frequently wrought, that they might have ſeen them, either before or after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, though they were not done purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for them, when they required it. Thoſe, of whom Chriſt at any time required Faith, before he would work Miracles, were either ſuch as had ſome malicious and captious Prejudice againſt him, or ſuch as came to be cured of their Diſeaſes and Infirmities.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) As for the Captious and Malicious, there was great Reaſon why they ſhould be rejected, and no Miracles ſhould be wrought for them. We read that <hi>he did not many migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty works</hi> in his own Country, <hi>becauſe of their Unbelief,</hi> Matth. xiii. 58. But though he did not many mighty Works there, yet he did ſome, which indeed were not many in compariſon of what he did in other Places. And there was a particular Reaſon why he did no more there, becauſe it was his own Country, and they upbraided him with his mean Birth and Education; whereupon Jeſus ſeeing them <hi>offended in him, ſaid unto them, A Prophet is not without Honour, ſave in his own Country, and in his own Houſe;</hi> and ſo, as it immediately follows, <hi>he did not many
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:61773:593"/>mighty Works there becauſe of their Unbelief.</hi> He had done many wonderful Works in the adjacent Countries, and his Fame was ſpread throughout all <hi>Galilee;</hi> but he, who knew the Hearts of all Men,
<note n="(x)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Non quod etiam, illis incredulis, facere non potuerit virtutes multas, ſed ne multas faciens vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, eives incredulos con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnaret.</hi> Hiet. ad loc.</note> ſaw how unſucceſsful all his Works would be upon his own unhappy Country-Men, who had been ſo little moved with what they had heard of him, and with what many of them probably had ſeen him do in other Places, that they only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided and vilified him: And he, who had ſo tender a Compaſſion for all Mankind, and with great Affection wept over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> could not but have ſuch a Concern for his own Country, as to refrain the working of thoſe Miracles, which he had otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, foreſeeing, that they would only ſerve to aggravate their Guilt, and encreaſe their Damnation, till by his Reſurrection he ſhould give an undeniable Evidence of his Divine Power, and then ſhould ſend his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples among them after his Aſcenſion, to whom they would have greater regard, as to Strangers, againſt whom they had not that unjuſt and fooliſh Prejudice. For we never read, that the Apoſtles did any where forbear to work Miracles, becauſe of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, but in all Places, and among all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they ſhewed forth the wonderful Works of God. But when the Works of Chriſt,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:61773:594"/>which were ſo wonderful, and ſo well known in all Parts of <hi>Galilee,</hi> had ſo ill effect upon thoſe of his own Country: St. <hi>Mark</hi> ſays, That <hi>he could there do no mighty Work, ſave that he laid his hands upon a few ſick folk and healed them, and he marvelled becauſe of their Unbelief,</hi> Mark vi. 5, 6. He wrought ſuch Miracles as his infinite Goodneſs meerly drew from him, and then wondred at the Obſtinacy of their Unbelief, which hindred him from working any more. For there are ſome things which God himſelf cannot do, not for want of Power, but becauſe it would imply an Imperfection in him, a Defect of Power, and a Contradiction to his Divine Nature to do them. <hi>God cannot lye, he abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth faithful, he cannot deny himſelf,</hi> 2 Tim. ii. 13. Tit. i. 2. He can act nothing unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming his own Wiſdom and Goodneſs; he cannot do Miracles, when he ſees they will be to no good purpoſe, but will be abuſed to a very ill one. Yet to ſhew his Compaſſion, and to manifeſt that his Power was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained in it ſelf, but that their Unbelief had reſtrained it from them, he laid his Hands upon the Sick and healed them, but did no more; for he can do nothing improper and unfit to be done.</p>
                     <p>The requiring of more Miracles, when ſufficient had been wrought already, was a <hi>Tempting</hi> and Provoking of God, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly to bid Defiance to his Power, and
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:61773:594"/>to Challenge him to do whatever they durſt demand of him. Our Saviour therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes the Scribes and the Phariſees and the Sadducees for Seeking after a Sign, <hi>Matth.</hi> xii. 39. xvi. 2. But the firſt time, he had wrought a Miracle juſt before in the Cure of the Man, whoſe Hand was withered, and of the blind and dumb Man, who was poſſeſt with a Devil; and when they ſtill required farther Signs, and being unmoved with what had been already done, they had now char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him with caſting out Devils by <hi>Belzebub,</hi> our Lord had great Reaſon to refuſe to work any more Miracles before ſuch obſtinate and ungrateful Men, which he ſaw were ſo far loſt upon them, that that ſerved only to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them altogether unpardonable in Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming the Holy Ghoſt; and therefore he tells them, That there was no other Sign left for them, who had not yet incurred that Sin which was never to be forgiven, but the Reſurrection of the Son of Man. This was a Sign which might convince the moſt Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, and which denied to none, but was reſerved as the laſt means. And ſeveral things which were done and ſaid by Chriſt in private, were not to be divulged till after his Reſurrection, becauſe before they might fall under Suſpicion; but <hi>that,</hi> and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wrought by vertue of it, would ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prove whatſoever his Diſciples ſhould ſay of him. When they again demanded
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:61773:595"/>a Sign, he had a little before healed great Multitudes, and had fed ſeveral Thouſands by Miracle in the Wilderneſs, and therefore he again refers this <hi>wicked and adulterous Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of Men <hi>to the Sign of the Prophet Jonas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have as little Reaſon to imagine, that our Saviour ſhould work Miracles to gratifie the Curioſity of <hi>Herod, Luke</hi> xxiii. 8. who <hi>hoped to have ſeen ſome Miracle done by him;</hi> or that he ſhould expoſe his Divine Power to <hi>Herod</hi>'s Contempt and Mockery, when he had ſo lately wrought a Miracle in curing the Ear of <hi>Malchus,</hi> who was ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in him, that he was one of them who came to apprehend him. It was an Act of Mercy to Cure this Man, but to work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles only to give Men an occaſion to vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that Power by which they were done, could be neither worthy of God, nor any Charity to Men, but it would have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable to the Character and Authority of Chriſt, to debaſe himſelf to a compliance with them, who uſed him with ſuch Scorn and Deriſion, and only reviled and tempted him. <hi>Herod</hi> was diſappointed in his hope and expectation of ſeeing a Miracle, and was not denied it for want of Faith: For he believed that Chriſt had wrought Miracles, and ſuppoſed that <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> whom he had Beheaded, <hi>was riſen from the dead,</hi> and that <hi>therefore mighty Works did ſhew forth themſelves in him,</hi> Matth. xiv. 2. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:61773:595"/>him not to be <hi>John the Baptiſt, he ſet him at naught.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) In the caſe of thoſe, who came to deſire his help for the Cure of themſelves and others, though they had not ſeen any Miracle wrought by him before, yet it was reaſonable that Chriſt ſhould work no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle for them, if they wanted Faith in what he had already wrought, and did not believe him able to perform, what they would ſeem to expect and deſire him to do. When he had given ſo many Demonſtrations of a Divine Power, he might juſtly expect an Acknowledgment and Belief of it in all, that came to him, and would receive any Benefit from it. He might ſurely beſtow his Favours and Benefits upon his own Terms; and no Terms could be more reaſonable, than that thoſe who came to ask them ſhould really believe, that he was able to beſtow them, and ſhould apply themſelves to him with an expectation to receive what they asked of him: Otherwiſe to come to him for Cure, was no better than to <hi>Tempt,</hi> to Mock and Deride him; it was to ask what they did not believe he could beſtow; but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd only to try what he could do, ſuppoſing that if they received no good, yet however there could be no hurt in the Experiment.</p>
                     <p>Now can any Man think, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, which Chriſt wrought, were to be beſtowed upon no better Conſiderations than
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:61773:596"/>theſe? Or that thoſe were in any meaſure worthy to be Cured, who came with ſo indifferent an Opinion of him, and with ſo little expectation of Relief? Chriſt wanted no opportunities of ſhewing his Power; he had ſhewn it in many and wonderful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and would do it again as often as he ſaw occaſion, upon fit and proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: But if they ſo little regarded what he had already done, as not to believe that he had done it, and could again perform the ſame, they but ill deſerved what they came for; the Divine Power and Goodneſs was not thus to be debaſed and expoſed, as to be employed in the Cure of Men, who ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what they did not believe he could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, but only thought it would coſt them nothing to make the Tryal, and for that Reaſon made Application to him. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour therefore ſays to the Father, who came to him in behalf of his Deaf and Dumb Son; <hi>If thou canſt believe all things are poſſible to him, that believeth;</hi> and upon that humble and paſſionate Declaration, <hi>Lord I believe, help thou my unbelief,</hi> the evil Spirit was caſt out of his Son, <hi>Mark</hi> ix. 23.24.</p>
                     <p>The End and Deſign of Chriſt's Miracles required, that thoſe, who were Cured by him, ſhould believe in him. For they were wrought with a deſign to convince Men that he was the Son of God, and that he was come not ſo much to Cure their Bodies, as
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:61773:596"/>to ſave their Souls, and he forgave their Sins at the ſame time that he healed them of their Diſeaſes, <hi>Mark</hi> ii. 5. And ſince Faith is ſo neceſſary a Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, it was as requiſite that Chriſt ſhould teach this, as any other Doctrine: But how could he do it more properly and more effectually than by requiring Faith in thoſe who came to be healed? If they would partake of his Mercy, they muſt qualifie themſelves for it, by believing that he was the great Prophet and Meſſias, who was then ſo much expected, and of whom it was foretold, that he ſhould make <hi>the Blind to ſee, and the Lame to walk, and the Deaf to hear,</hi> &amp;c. Luke vii. 22. Iſa. xxxv. 5. And unleſs their Bodily Cure did conduce to the Cure of their Souls by Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, it would be but ill beſtowed upon them, and therefore with great Reaſon might be denied them. And upon this Account we find our Bleſſed Saviour both requiring Faith in ſome, and rewarding it in others, to whom his miraculous Power was extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Luke</hi> viii. 48. xviii. 42. And St. <hi>Paul perceiving</hi> that the Cripple at <hi>Lyſtra had Faith to be healed,</hi> immediately healed him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ask'd to do it, <hi>Acts</hi> xiv. 9.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Faith in the Miracles of Chriſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of Men in all Ages of the World, though Miracles are ceaſed; and if this be Reaſonable now, it could not but be fitting
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:61773:597"/>then, that thoſe who came to Chriſt, ſhould believe in him for the ſake of the Miracles, which they had been certified that he had done upon others. For Miracles, when they are fully atteſted, are as ſufficient a Ground of Faith, as if we had ſeen them done; and to manifeſt that they are ſo, our Saviour might require Belief in his former Miracles, of thoſe who expected any Advantage from ſuch as they deſired him to do. If they would give no Credit to the Miracles, which were ſo notorious, and ſo abundantly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Multitudes who ſaw them done, how ſhould others believe in Times to come, when no more Miracles ſhould be wrought for the Conviction of Unbelievers? Might no Man be required to believe, unleſs he ſaw the Miracles himſelf? Then how ſhould the the Church ſubſiſt in future Ages, when Miracles would be no longer wrought, but were for great Reaſons to be with-held? We muſt now believe upon the Account of the Miracles which were then done, and why therefore ſhould they not be required to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve upon the Account of them, who lived at the very Time, and in the ſame Country where they were wrought, though they had never ſeen them? Our Saviour in theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances might introduce that Method, and eſtabliſh the Evidence and Certainty of thoſe Means and Motives, whereby Faith was to be produced in Men of all ſucceeding Ages,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:61773:597"/>and might hereby ſignifie and declare, that he requires the ſame Faith of us from the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of others, that he would do, if we had ſeen and experienced his miraculous Power our ſelves.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>PRophecies are generally of more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, and afford greater Evidence and Conviction in future Ages, than when they were firſt delivered. For it is not the Delivery, but the Accompliſhment of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which gives Evidence to the Truth of any Doctrin: The Events of Things in the Accompliſhment of Prophecies are a ſtanding Argument to all Ages, and the length of Time adds to its Force and Efficacy; and therefore when all that God ſaw requiſite to be foretold, is deliver'd to us in the Scriptures, there can no longer be any need of New Prophecies; which would be of leſs Authority than the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ones, inaſmuch as their Antiquity is the thing chiefly to be regarded in Prophecies. For if to foretel Things to come be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of a Divine Preſcience; the longer Things are foretold before they come to paſs, the better muſt the Argument needs
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:61773:598"/>be. He therefore that requires New Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies to confirm the Old, little conſiders the Nature of Prophecies, and wherein the Evidence and Uſe of them lies; but in great Wiſdom and Caution will give no Credit to the beſt Evidence, unleſs there were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs evident to prove it by.</p>
                     <p>The chief Enquiry then ſeems to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Ceſſation of Miracles; but from what has been elſewhere ſaid, the Reaſon may appear, why the miraculous Power, which the Apoſtles received by the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, was not to be of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual continuance in the Church, but was to ceaſe in future Ages. For the Cauſe and End of the Gift of Miracles beſtowed upon the Apoſtles, was to make them capable of being <hi>Witneſſes</hi> to Chriſt; and when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt was ſufficiently teſtified, there could be no longer need of ſuch a Power, which was given to enable Men to bear Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to it. For what is once effectually proved by ſufficient Witneſſes, is for ever proved, and needs no after Evidence, if this Proof be preſerved and tranſmitted down to Poſterity. The Power of Miracles continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till the Goſpel had been Preached not only <hi>in Jeruſalem, and in all Judea, and in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi> but <hi>unto the utmoſt Parts of the Earth;</hi> which was the declared Intention of our Saviour in beſtowing it, <hi>Acts</hi> i. 8. And when the Goſpel had ſtood at the Tryals, and
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:61773:598"/>conquered all the Oppoſition that could be made againſt it by <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> and Apoſtates themſelves; when Miracles had been wrought for ſeveral Ages, before all ſorts of Men, upon all Occaſions, and had extorted a Confeſſion from the Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Divine Power, by which they were wrought; when the Books of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Evangeliſts, in which theſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are Recorded, had been diſperſed in all Nations and Languages, ſo that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the Memory of them ſhould be loſt; whence once the Goſpel was thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged and atteſted to the World, it could not be neceſſary that this miraculous Power ſhould be any longer continued: Becauſe this is the only Reaſon and Deſign why Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles ſhould be wrought, to awaken Mens Attention, and prepare them for the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Doctrin which is revealed, and convince them of the Truth of it.</p>
                     <p>If then it be enquired, Why the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Gifts, which were at firſt beſtow'd upon the Church, were not continued to it in all ſucceeding Ages? The plain Anſwer is; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Power was beſtowed for the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Chriſtian Religion in the World, by convincing Men of its Truth and Authority; and therefore, when a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Evidence had been given in all Parts of the World, of the Divine Authority of that Religion, upon the Account whereof

                     <p>And thus it was likewiſe under the Law. It is obſervable, that we read of no mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Power beſtowed upon any Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Moſes.</hi> The Creation of the World was dilivered down with undeniable Certainty, and the miraculous Judgments of God in Drowning the Old World, in the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Tongues, and in the Puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to keep up a Senſe of the True Religion. But when a new Inſtitution of Religion was to be introduced by <hi>Moſes,</hi> miraculous Gifts were neceſſary to give Authority to it, and to oppoſe thoſe falſe and lying Wonders which were in uſe among the Magicians in <hi>Egypt</hi> and other Places. In the former Ages Predictions were very frequent, and they were delivered by the Patriarchs, who were Men of unqueſtionable Credit and Authority, and could have no need of Miracles to confirm the Truth of their Prophecies, which were ſo uſual in thoſe Times; and when the Lives of Men were ſo long, divers Prophecies of the ſame Perſons had been verified by the Event. But <hi>Moſes</hi> had a New Law to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver, and both He and the Prophets had a a ſtubborn People to deal with, to whom the
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:61773:599"/>Meſſage they were charged withal, was commonly very unwelcome; ſo that till this Inſtitution was fully ſettled, Miracles became neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>But when the Old Teſtament had been ſufficiently authorized and eſtabliſhed by Prophecies and Miracles, and when by the Captivities and Diſperſions of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Divine Miſſion of their Prophets became known among ſo many other Nations; when the <hi>Jews</hi> were reduced from Idolatry, which they never practiſed after their Return from their Captivity in <hi>Babylon;</hi> and when they had made numerous Converſions amongſt the Heathens, then theſe miraculous Gifts were no longer continued, as they had been before, in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, inſomuch that it became a

                        </note> Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> by an hiſtorical Account of Miracles from the Times of the Apoſtles through the Ages next ſucceeding, has ſhewn, that they were always adapted to the Neceſſities of the Church, being more or leſs frequent, as the State of the Church required, till they at laſt wholly ceaſed, when there was no longer any need of them. For the only end and uſe of miraculous Gifts is the Confirmation and Eſtabliſhment of Religion, and therefore when this is once fully confirmed and eſtabliſhed, they can be no longer needful. But it ſeems rather ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that they ſhould afterwards ceaſe,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:61773:601"/>than that they ſhould be continued; I mean, as to any conſtant Power of working Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles reſiding in the Church. For tho' there may poſſibly be ſome extraordinary Caſes, in which it may pleaſe God to manifeſt a miraculous Power, yet there is no Reaſon to conclude that a conſtant Power of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Miracles ſhould be continued to the Church, but rather that thoſe Gifts ſhould ceaſe, when Religion has been confirmed by a perpetual Courſe of Miracles for ſome Hundreds of Years together. Becauſe</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Miracles, when they became common, would loſe the deſign and end, and the very Nature of Miracles. For the Nature of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles conſiſts in this, that they are an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary VVork of God; not that they are more difficult, than the ordinary works of Nature: All things are alike eaſy to God, and Miracles are as eaſy as any thing in the conſtant courſe of Nature can be; the only difference is, that Miracles are his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Work, they are more apt to raiſe our Wonder and Admiration, and to put us in mind of a Divine Preſence. For we wonder at ſtrange and unuſual things, and ſuppoſe a more than ordinary Reaſon for them. But if Miracles had continued in all Ages, this Effect of Miracles would have ceaſed, and they would no longer have been Miracles, but a kind of different Courſe of Nature. For, according to the beſt and moſt accurate
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:61773:601"/>Philoſophy, nothing in the ſettled Courſe of Nature can be performed without an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Influence of the Divine Power; but in Miracles this Power manifeſts its ſelf in an extraordinary manner, above and contrary to the Eſtabliſhed Laws, or Rules, which God has in all other caſes preſcribed for the producing Effects.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Men would fancy to themſelves ſome kind of Scheme, or other, and would frame ſome Notions and Conceits to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Miracles; or they would imagin them to return of Courſe at certain Periods, or upon ſome Accidents, if they ſaw them frequently done, or perhaps they would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to proceed from ſome Defect in the Nature of Things, which could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways keep its courſe, but made many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viations from it. But when Miracles were wrought only in ſome Ages for peculiar Reaſons, this ſhews that they were done by an immediate Divine Power, with a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Deſign, which could be no other, than the Confirmation of Religion, ſince they ceaſed both under the Law and the Goſpel, when both were fully declared and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. A perpetual Power of Miracles in all Ages would give occaſion to continual Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures, which would confound and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract Mens minds, and would make the true Mircles themſelves ſuſpected. We ſee
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:61773:602"/>now that the Dreams of every Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſt, and the Pretences of every Impoſtor are apt to ſtartle weak minds, tho' we have ſo much Reaſon not to expect Miracles, or Revelations. But if we were in conſtant expectation of True Miracles, the Falſe would be much more likely to miſlead ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and to make others reject the Belief of any Miracles at all.</p>
                     <p>If Prophecies and Miracles had been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church to the coming of our Saviour, his Prophecies and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Works had not ſo well diſtinguiſhed and manifeſted him to be the Chriſt. But when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo long an Intermiſſion, they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain revived in him, this ſhewed him to be the great Prophet and <hi>Meſſias</hi> who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. And it is very obſervable, that as Miracles had been diſcontinued for a long time among the <hi>Jews;</hi> ſo St. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> who was more than a Prophet, and one of the greateſt of all the Men that had been before him; yet wrought no Miracles, that he might be the better diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and that there might ariſe no doubt in the Minds of any, which of them was the Chriſt. And when our Saviour had been acknowledged to be the Chriſt in all Parts of the World, it was fit that Miracles ſhould ceaſe, to preſerve the Authority due to the Miracles wrought by himſelf, and his Diſciples, it being more for the Honour of
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:61773:602"/>Chriſt, that the Miracles wrought in his Name ſhould ceaſe, when his Religion had been fully Eſtabliſhed, than that Men ſhould be tempted to doubt who was the true Chriſt, and which was the true Religion, upon the account of falſe Miracles wrought in oppoſition to the True.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Another Reaſon why the Gift of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles has been with-held in latter Ages may be this; becauſe ſince there has been a general depravation of Manners among Chriſtians, it would have proved a great occaſion of Pride and Vain-Glory to thoſe who had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt it, as we find it was to ſome even in the times of the Apoſtles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. xiv. And our Saviour ſaw it requiſite to give Caution to his Diſciples, <hi>Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this rejoice not, that the Spirits are ſubject unto you, but rather rejoice, becauſe your Names are written in Heaven,</hi> Luke x. 20. It muſt be an eminent and truly Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Piety, that could bear the having of ſuch Gifts with an humble and Chriſtian Temper of Mind.</p>

                     <p>However, though there be no ſuch change as was wont formerly to be wrought in the viſible Courſe of Nature, in Confirmation of our Religion, yet there is ſtill a Divine Power evident among Chriſtians living in Heathen Countries.

                     <p>THough the Chriſtian Religion be moſt certain in it ſelf, yet there is a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Grace required to make us through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and effectually convinced of the certainty of it. <hi>No Man can come to me,</hi> ſays our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>except the Father, which hath ſent me, draw him;</hi> and this is declared to be the Reaſon of the Infidelity of ſuch as were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at his Doctrin, and departed from him. <hi>But there are ſome of you that believe not: for Jeſus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not; and who ſhould betray him; and he ſaid, Therefore ſaid I unto you, that no Man can come unto me, except it be given unto him of my Father,</hi> John vi. 64, 65. So that the Belief of the Goſpel is ſtiled a <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> not only in reſpect of its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but of its efficient Cauſe. In attaining to the Knowledge of the Truth of Religion, we muſt proceed upon the ſame Principles of Reaſon, by which we proceed in attaining to the Knowledge of any other Truth. But
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:61773:604"/>Reaſon, when it comes up to the Evidence even of Demonſtration, though it ſatisfies the Underſtanding, yet doth not neceſſarily gain that firm and laſting Aſſent of the Will, which is required in Faith; but when the thing proved to be true, is unacceptable, againſt the Inclinations of the Will, and againſt the former Opinions and Perſuaſions of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, the preſent Convictions of the Underſtanding are ſoon ſtifled and overpower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the prevailing Force of the Will and Affections, which carry the Mind off to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and contrary Objects, which it has been wont to think of and believe. Thus it was in the <hi>Academicks</hi> and <hi>Scepticks;</hi> they could not but have the ſame ſenſe of Mathematical Demonſtrations, and other clear Truths, which the reſt of Mankind have, whilſt they thought of them, and attended ſtrictly to them: But by a conſtant Practice to amuſe themſelves with Subtilties, they had wrought themſelves to a Perſuaſion, that nothing could be certainly known to be true; and this general and habitual Opinion ſoon ſtifled the Evidence of any particular Truth, which could be repreſented never ſo clearly to their Minds.</p>
                     <p>To as many therefore as lay under long and violent Prejudices, by reaſon of their former Opinions, and of their Pride and Vanity in contending for them; or by reaſon of any of thoſe Luſts, which are ſo
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:61773:605"/>contrary to the Purity of the Goſpel; to ſuch, an extraordinary and miraculous Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Grace was neceſſary to eſtabliſh them in the Faith, or elſe, though they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the preſent at the ſight of ſome Miracle, yet this was no laſting or well-grounded Faith, <hi>John</hi> ii. 23, 24. And that Grace, which was neceſſary to their Faith, was denied to ſome for their Sins, <hi>that they ſhould not ſee with their Eyes, nor underſtand with their Heart, and be converted,</hi> John xii, 40. So that Men of great Learning and worldly Wiſdom might ſtill continue Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and not ſubmit to all the Evidence of the Goſpel, becauſe the Doctrin of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel being ſo contrary to their Habitual Thoughts and Inclinations, there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing neceſſary to convert the Will and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and to ſubdue the former Habits which had been rooted in their Minds by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Acts and length of Time, and which were too ſtrong for any Convictions of the Underſtanding, that conſiſted but in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient Acts, and were ſoon loſt and vaniſhed, through the prevailing contrary Habits both of the Underſtanding, and Will, and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. And therefore Faith muſt neceſſarily be an effect of Grace as well as of Reaſon; and where, becauſe of former Sins and Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, this Grace was not vouchſafed, there could be no Faith, though there might be ſome tranſient Convictions of Mind, ſome
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:61773:605"/>faint Glimmerings, which were ſoon damped and extinguiſhed, being overpowered by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer contrary Perſuaſions. And for the ſame Reaſon, thoſe who had leſs Wiſdom and Knowledge, but were not under the Power of Habitual Luſts and Paſſions, and therefore were more eaſily perſuaded to any thing, of the Truth whereof they were once convinced, were likewiſe the more eaſily converted.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes why the Word became un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful, and ſo little prevailed with many Men, are in the Parable of the <hi>Sower</hi> declared to be either inconſiderate Negligence and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and the Advantage taken from thence by Satan, or want of Conſtancy in Times of <hi>Tribulations</hi> and <hi>Perſecutions,</hi> or <hi>the Cares of this World, and the Deceitfulneſs of Riches, and the Luſts of other things,</hi> Matth. xiii. 18.

They were not Natural ſo much as Moral Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not ſo much Parts and Learning, as an honeſt and humble Mind, which were the requiſite Qualifications for Men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſtians: Becauſe as God the more freely beſtowed his Grace upon Men thus qualified, ſo they were the better diſpoſed to be wrought upon by it; whereas others, though they wanted a greater meaſure of Grace, yet had leſs vouchſafed to them.

But the invincible Patience and glorious Sufferings of the Chriſtians pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed againſt all the Rage and Force of their Enemies. If the Martyrologies of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions were to be compared, there would ſoon appear ſo manifeſt a difference between the Chriſtian Martyrs and the Sufferers for other Religions, that nothing would be needful to be ſaid upon this ſubject. But remembring with whom I have to deal, I am reſolved to take every thing at the loweſt, and argue with them upon their own Terms. Let us for a while ſet aſide whatever of this nature might be ſaid in preference of the Chriſtian Martyrs, and ſuppoſe the Numbers and Zeal of the Martyrs (for ſo we muſt call them at preſent) of other Religions, to have been as great as can be imagined, yet the Cauſe it ſelf makes a plain difference between them.</p>
                     <p>An ignorant Zeal in a wrong Cauſe is no Argument againſt the Goodneſs of any Cauſe, which is maintained and promoted by ſuch a Zeal as is reaſonable, and proceeds upon ſure Grounds. Indeed, it were very hard and very ſtrange, if that which is true, ſhould be ever the leſs certain, or the leſs to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded and eſteemed, becauſe there may be other things that are falſe, of which ſome
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:61773:619"/>Men are as firmly perſuaded, and are as much concerned for them, as any one can be for the Truth it ſelf. And yet this is the wiſeſt thing that many have to pretend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the certainty of the Religion, in which they were Baptiſed, that there are many Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures in the World, and none is without its Zealots to appear in Vindication of it. I am confident no Man ever parted with any thing, but his Religion, upon ſo weak a Pretence.</p>
                     <p>A falſe Religion is not the only thing for which Men are wont to have an undeſerved Value; but their Country, their Friends, and themſelves they are commonly as much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in, and do as highly overprize: Is there then no real difference, or ſolid worth in any of theſe? Some of the moſt unlikely Countrys in the World have been admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Natives, as if they were the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> and the Place of <hi>Paradiſe:</hi> Though there is nothing eaſier, than to make a diſtinction concerning different Countrys.

There is nothing, eſpecially if it be of any Moment and Conſequence to them, for which Men have not ſhewn themſelves paſſionately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; and it is not to be expected that they ſhould be ſo much more infallible in
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:61773:620"/>Religion than in other things, or ſhould be ſo much leſs in earneſt about it, as not to diſcover the ſame Frailties, and the ſame Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which are viſible in all the other Actions and Buſineſs of their Lives.</p>
                     <p>It is often ſeen in moſt Caſes, that ſome are as earneſt and zealous in a falſe Cauſe, as others are in a True; but doth this prove that there is no difference between Falſhood and Truth? When two Men of oppoſite Parties are equally confident of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Cauſe, it is certain that but one of them can be in the right; and it is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that one of them muſt be, at leaſt, ſo far in the right, as he contradicts the other; becauſe, as the two Parts of a Contradiction cannot be both True, ſo they cannot be both Falſe. If then a confident and zealous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion doth not determine Right and Wrong, True and Falſe, the remaining difficulty is how to diſtinguiſh them, and that muſt be by the proper Evidence, and the intrinſick Goodneſs of the Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>And our Evidence in behalf of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is plain matter of Fact, as the Death, and Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, and the Miracles wrought by him and his Apoſtles. And if our Religion has ſufficient Proof of what we aſſert in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, and other Religions have not ſufficient Proof of that Authority to which they lay claim, this muſt determine the
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:61773:620"/>Point, though a <hi>Mahometan</hi> or <hi>Pagan</hi> ſhould be as zealous for his Religion, as a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> can be. It is commonly and truly ſaid, that it is not the Suffering, but the Cauſe, which makes the Martyr; and if Men of Falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions have never ſo much Confidence of the Truth of them, and have no Ground for it, this can be no Argument againſt the Grounds and Proofs upon which the Evidence of the Chriſtian Religion depends. Other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may have their Zealots, who offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to die for them, but the Chriſtian Religion properly has the only Martyrs. For Martyrs are <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is capable of being atteſted in ſuch a manner as the Chriſtian Religion; no other Religion was ever propagated by Witneſſes, who had ſeen and heard, and been every way converſant in what they witneſſed concerning the Principles of their Religion; no Religion beſides was ever preached by Men, who, after an unalterable Conſtancy under all kinds of Sufferings, at laſt died for aſſerting it, when they muſt of neceſſity have known, whether it were true or falſe, and therefore certainly knew it to be true, or elſe they would never have ſuffered and died in that manner for it; no other Religion was ever attoſted from its firſt Propagation for ſeveral Hundreds of Years together, by Men who had either ſeen the firſt Preachers themſelves, or had been acquainted with others who
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:61773:621"/>had ſeen them, or had wrought Miracles, and ſeen others work them; no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is contained in Books, which were written at the firſt Propagation of it, and diſpers'd into all Countries, in all Languages, amongſt all ſorts of Men, and eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe who were moſt concerned, and moſt able and deſirous to diſprove it, if it had been falſe; no Religion beſides has by ſo weak and unlikely means prevailed over all the Power and Policy of the World; none is in its Doctrin ſo agreeable to Reaſon, and ſo worthy of God for its Author; and none has been delivered down with ſo clear a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and uninterrupted Teſtimony through all Ages, and conveyed by a ſucceſſion of Teſtimonies to this preſent Age: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no other Religion can have Martyrs, who can die in confirmation of ſuch a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony as this, or who can be Martyrs and Witneſſes to it by aſſuring the World at their Death, that they have received the Religion thus teſtified and confirmed, for which they die.</p>
                     <p>It is not the bare aſſerting a thing boldly, and then dying for it, which makes a Martyr, but the Qualifications neceſſary in a Witneſs are neceſſary in him, that is, that he ſhould have all Opportunities needful to know the Truth, as well as no Temptation to ſpeak the contrary. Which Qualifications were evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the Apoſtles and firſt Martyrs, whoſe
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:61773:621"/>Teſtimony is that upon which the Proof of our Religion is founded, and the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of latter Ages are additional Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which without the former would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant, but ſuppoſing them are all the Teſtimony that can be given to any matter of Fact at this diſtance of Time, and are as much beyond the Sufferings in behalf of any other Religion, as the Evidence of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion is beyond the Evidence for all others.</p>
                     <p>It is not merely Zeal, though it proceed even to Death and Martyrdom, upon which we build our Faith, but the Reaſons which Chriſtians have for their Zeal. Divers Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been as earneſt Aſſertors of their Fabulous Antiquities, as others can be of theirs, which are known to be true; but are theſe ever the leſs, or thoſe ever the more true upon that account? We inſiſt upon it, that we have Books to ſhew, and clear Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to produce for what we maintain, and theſe have been examined by many Men in every Age, and compared with what is to be alleged in behalf of contrary Religions, and Men of the greateſt Learning and Judgment and Prudence have choſen to die rather than to renounce this Religion for any other, after the niceſt and moſt impartial Examination they could make. Whereas the Zealots and Martyrs for the Religions which are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Chriſtianity, muſt be acknowledged
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:61773:622"/>to be Men that underſtand nothing of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, but are ignorant of the Hiſtory of their ſeveral Religions, and take all upon uncertain Report, and abſurd Traditions, without any Proof or Poſſibility of it, and even againſt manifeſt Reaſon, and the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of undoubted Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>So plain is it, that the Zeal and Confidence of Men of falſe Religions, and their willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to die for them can be no prejudice to the Authority and Certainty of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The Enthuſiaſms and vain Notions and Conceits of ſome Zealots can be no more a Prejudice to the Truth and Reality of our Religion, than it is an Argument againſt the Truth and Certainty of Human Reaſon, that there are ſo many Fools and Madmen in the World.</p>

                     <p>THere is nothing which has proved a a greater Snare and Scandal to weak Minds, nor which gives the Enemies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion greater Advantage, as they think, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, than the Diſſentions amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:61773:622"/>and the different Sects and Parties into which they are divided. This makes ſome willing to conclude that there is no certainty on any ſide, when they ſee equal Zeal and equal Confidence in Men of all Perſuaſions, that contend for their ſeveral Opinions.</p>
                     <p>But St. <hi>Paul</hi> writes to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that there muſt be not only Diviſions, but Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies alſo, and not only that they muſt be, but that they are not without their uſe and expediency in the Church; They are ſo far from being any real Prejudice to the Truth and Certainty of Religion, that they do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed conduce to manifeſt the Excellency of it, and the Sincerity of thoſe that profeſs it. <hi>For there muſt be alſo Hereſies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifeſt among you,</hi> 1 Cor. xi. 19. From whence I ſhall ſhew, I. That Differences in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion muſt be among Chriſtians, unleſs God ſhould miraculouſly and irreſiſtibly interpoſe to prevent them. II. That it is not neceſſary nor expedient, that God ſhould thus interpoſe. III. That theſe Differences, how great and how many ſoever they be, even the worſt of Schiſms and Hereſies, are no prejudice to the Truth and Authority of Religion.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. That Differences in matters of Religion muſt be among Chriſtians, unleſs God ſhould miraculouſly and irreſiſtibly interpoſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them. <hi>There muſt be alſo Hereſies among
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:61773:623"/>you:</hi> The miraculous Power and Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an infallible Spirit in the Apoſtles themſelves could not hinder the riſe of them. <hi>It muſt needs be,</hi> ſays our Saviour, <hi>that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,</hi> or <hi>it is impoſſible but that Offences will come; but wo unto him through whom they come,</hi> Matth. xviii. 7. Luke xvii.</p>
                     <p>The Church can by no means be free from Offences, Scandals and Diviſions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God ſhould forcibly reſtrain Men from running into them.</p>
                     <p>The Tempers and Capacities of Men are very different, and therefore in many Caſes they will make a different Judgment of Things. Much Attention and Thoughtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and an exact Knowledg of Antiquity, is requiſite to make a true Judgment in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Controverſies, and few Men are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be at that pains, which is neceſſary to inform themſelves aright in leſſer Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; they are contented to take up with the Appearances of things, which firſt offer themſelves, or to which by Cuſtom and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation they have been moſt uſed: There is ſo much Difficulty to get rid of Prejudices, ſo much Labour and Study is in many caſes required in the ſearch after Truth, that few can prevail with themſelves to undergo it. Few Men examine the Ground of things, and fewer do it to any Purpoſe; moſt Men follow, as they are led, without any further Care, or Thought, and die in the Religion
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:61773:623"/>in which they were brought up, without much troubling themſelves whether it be true or falſe, but taking all upon Truſt, if they happen to be in the Right, it is by chance, and more than they know, or are able to prove; if they be in the Wrong, they know as little of it, but Right, or Wrong, they follow the Example of others, of whom they have conceived a favourable Opinion, or who have ſome Authority with them to influence them; they profeſs their Religion, as they practiſe other things, for no better Reaſon, than becauſe they ſee others have done it before them, and they ſtand up for it only, as they do for all Cuſtoms, which by long uſe are become familiar, and almoſt natural to them, but may be worn out by a different Practice and Cuſtom.</p>
                     <p>And when the Generality of Men are thus careleſs and unconcerned to examine the Grounds and Principles of their ſeveral Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, this gives a mighty Opportunity and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to Men of ill Principles, and ill De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, to infuſe and ſpread their Opinions. For if by the Plauſibleneſs and Importunity of their Inſinuations, or by the Profeſſion of a more than ordinary Zeal and Strictneſs in ſome things, that are moſt popular, they can but gain a few Perſons of Note and Intereſt, who may influence others, a Party is made, and a Sect ſet up, which may perhaps conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for ſome Generations; and a fondneſs
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:61773:624"/>for Novelty, and a Perſonal Diſlike and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt ſome Men, and an Eſteem and Admiration of others, and ſeveral Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, as they fall in with the ſeveral Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Inclinations of Men, may make great Additions to a Sect that is once form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Men, who thought themſelves diſobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> were wont to go o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the <hi>Samaritans;</hi> and Deſerters, in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are as uſual as in War, upon any great Diſcontent, or upon hopes of great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. And theſe Men to Teſtify their Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, are obſerved commonly to be moſt Violent; however they ſerve to make a Number, and to ſtrengthen a Party.</p>
                     <p>Moſt Schiſms and Hereſies have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by Men of ill Deſigns, who under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Godlineſs, gratified their own Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Ambition, or Covetouſneſs, or more Scandalous Vices. This was the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the Hereſies in the Apoſtles days, and it has been obſervable in the firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of them, ever ſince. An Affectation of Singularity, of Popular Fame, and Preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence have been the Occaſion of great Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieves in the Church. Some Men are as fond of their own New Opinions, as others are of Honours, or Wealth, or Pleaſure; and can bear no Contradiction, but contend for a kind of Empire in Knowledge, and ſhew a mighty Zeal to gain Proſelytes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is to extend their Conqueſts; and
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:61773:624"/>enlarge their Dominion over Mens Faith. Some that <hi>devoured Widows Houſes,</hi> have <hi>for a pretence made long Prayers.</hi> Matt. xxiii. 14. <hi>And it is a ſhame, and Horror, even to ſpeak of thoſe things,</hi> which have been done by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; not only <hi>in ſecret</hi> but openly, and in the View of the World, under the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and Zealous Profeſſions for the Glory of God, and the Good of Souls. And the Errors of Men of no ill meaning, but of great Zeal, with little Knowledg, have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found a ſtrange Acceptance in the World, for the ſake of that Integrity and Sincerity, which appeared in their firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
                     <p>Now when all the Paſſions and Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Vices of Men thus contribute to produce and promote Differences in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is no greater Wonder, that there are ſuch Differences, than that there are Frailties and Vices amongſt Men; that ſome Men are vicious, and ready to ſeduce others, and that others are eaſy to be ſeduced.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> complains of <hi>falſe Apoſtles, deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Workers, Transforming themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt, and no Marvel,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for Satan himſelf is Transformed into an Angel of Light; therefore it is no great thing, if his Miniſters alſo be Transformed, as the Miniſters of Righteouſneſs, whoſe end ſhall be according to their Works,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 13.14.15. Satan himſelf ſtrives to appear like an Angel of
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:61773:625"/>Light, and Sin is forced to take the diſguiſe of Religion. Vice is a thing, which few Men care much to own, how fond ſoever they be of it: Numbers in other caſes are wont to bring things into Reputation, but it is not ſo in moſt Vices, which tho' they have been practiſed by great Numbers of Men in all Ages, yet have been always nevertheleſs infamous; and this ſhews the deteſtable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Vice and Irreligion, that they could never become creditable in a vicious and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious World, but bad Men are aſhamed of them, and endeavour to conceal and hide them under ſome colour of Religion and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                     <p>But ſince every Vice, and every Paſſion, and Intereſt of Men may conduce to the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and ſomenting of Differences in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is as impoſſible, that they ſhould not be in the World, as that Sin it ſelf ſhould not be in it, which can never be wholly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, unleſs God ſhould force Men to be Good; and therefore it is impoſſible, that there ſhould be no Differences in Religion, unleſs the ſame Force and Neceſſity ſhould reſtrain Men from them.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. It is not neceſſary, nor expedient, that God ſhould miraculouſly and irreſiſtibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe to prevent Differences in Matters of Religion: Becauſe it would contradict the very Deſign of all Religion for God thus to interpoſe: The Deſign of Religion is to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:61773:625"/>and Command Men, what to Believe, and what to Do, upon ſuch Terms as may prevail with them by reaſonable Arguments; by Exhortations and Encouragements on the one hand, and Admonititions and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings on the other. But to force Men to be of one Mind, and one Profeſſion, would be to lay aſide theſe Terms, and to render the Motives and Arguments which Religion propoſeth uſeleſs, and to have no Regard to the Rewards, and Puniſhments, by which it is enjoyned. There can be no more Reaſon, that God ſhould conſtrain Men to have right Notions of Religion, than that he ſhould force them to obey thoſe Notions, and put them in Practice; or that he ſhould reſtrain Men from Hereſies and Schiſms; that is from ſuch Sins as more directly and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately concern Religion, rather than from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Sins: But there is great Reaſon, why it ſhould not be ſo, becauſe this would make Religion it ſelf uſeleſs and inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, by taking away the Grounds and Foundations of all Religions, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the Liberty of Mankind, which is neceſſary in all Acts of Religion. For, he that Acts by Neceſſity, cannot Act by the Principles of Religion, which adviſes and commands Men to <hi>refuſe the Evil, and chuſe the Good.</hi> Differences in Religion could not be prevented without over-ruling all the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and hindering all the Vices of Men,
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:61773:626"/>and without fruſtrating the Commands and Precepts, and contradicting the Deſign and Inſtitution of Religion; and it is not to be expected, that rather than ſuffer Differences in Religion, God ſhould ſo check and reſtrain Men, as not to leave them at Liberty to Act upon the Principles of Religion, but upon mere Force and Neceſſity. If Men be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Err and to Sin, they will Err and Sin in Matters relating to Religion, as well as in others, and to debar Men unavoidably from Sin and Error would be to proceed in ſuch a manner, as is inconſiſtent with the Motives and Arguments both of Reaſon and Religion, and to offer Violence, not only to human Nature, but to the Wiſdom and Counſel of God, in his Diſpenſations for the Salvation of Mankind.</p>
                     <p>It is the Wiſdom of God not to force Men upon doing Good, but to bring Good out of Evil, and if Men will reſolve to commit Sin, and will not be prevailed upon by all that God has ſaid and done to withdraw them from it; then to make their worſt Actions inſtrumental to his own Glory, and to the Salvation of other Men. And there is this good effect from the moſt pernicious Hereſies and Schiſms, <hi>That thoſe which are approved may be made manifeſt</hi> by them; that the Sincerity of the good Chriſtian may appear, and that the Diſguiſe may be taken off from Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, that they may be no longer able to
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:61773:626"/>ſeduce Men by a ſhew of Godlineſs. It is a juſt Judgment of God upon unrepenting Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to <hi>let them fall from one Wickedneſs to another, and not come into his Righteouſneſs;</hi> to puniſh ſecret Sins, by ſuffering Men to run into publick and notorious Crimes, whereby they diſcover and expoſe themſelves to the World. Thus it was in the caſe of thoſe Hereticks of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>They profeſt that they knew God, but in Works they denied him, being abominable and diſobedient, and to every good Work reprobate,</hi> Tit. i. 16. And giving a full and lamentable Deſcription of this ſort of Men, in concluſion he ſays, <hi>But they ſhall proceed no farther; for their Folly ſhall be manifeſt to all Men,</hi> 2 Tim. iii. 9. They were permitted to come to ſuch horrid and frightful degrees of Wickedneſs and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as that all Men, who meant well, would be ſure to avoid them, and to depart from them; and of thoſe who joined themſelves with ſuch Men, and went over to them, St. <hi>John</hi> declares, <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us: for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that they were not all of us,</hi> 1 John ii. 19.</p>
                     <p>And when theſe and ſuch like Hereſies break looſe, and diſturb the Peace of the Church, this makes all ſincere Chriſtians more careful and diligent to <hi>hold faſt the form of ſound Words, and earneſtly contend for the
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:61773:627"/>Faith which was once delivered to the Saints.</hi> Men are apt to be too careleſs and unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about Religion, when they meet with no Oppoſition: But when the Faith is denied, and the Terms of Salvation are diſputed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, this will ſtir up and actuate a mighty Zeal in all, who have any regard for the Honour of God, and the Salvation of Men. From whence it comes to paſs, that moſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies have been of no long continuance, but appear and ſhew themſelves, are diſproved, become odious, and after a while are hardly known, but from the Books of ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed them; and thoſe Points of Doctrin which were contradicted, become ſo much the better eſtabliſhed, and the more firmly believed for the future. Hereſies are but the Tryals of Religion, as Dangers are of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; it ſtands to the Honour and Evidence of Truth, to be exerciſed and encompaſſed with Errors, which fall before it, and are able to do it no hurt.</p>
                     <p>So that Differences in Religion are ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Almighty God, as all other Sins are, becauſe it is the deſign of Religion, not to compel Men, but to perſuade and exhort them, and to permit them to be guilty of all manner of Sin, whilſt it offers the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Arguments and Motives againſt it; and to be guilty of Schiſms and Hereſies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt: And theſe are Temptations and Tryals to good Men, and often ſerve
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:61773:627"/>as Judgments upon the wicked, to puniſh one Wickedneſs with another, and expoſe them to the World for Hypocrites and Impoſtors. And they ſerve to confirm the Articles of our Faith, which hereby become the more throughly examined, and the more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained. And theſe are ſufficient Reaſons, why God ſhould not by his Almighty Power hinder thoſe Differences in Religion, which muſt of neceſſity happen by the Sins and Folly Men, unleſs he ſhould miraculouſly and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtibly interpoſe to prevent them.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Theſe Differences how great and how many ſoever they may be, even the worſt of Schiſms and Hereſies are no Prejudice to the Truth and Certainty of Religion. Religion is our Direction, our Way to Heaven and Happineſs, but will any Man ſay, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are many wrong ways, therefore there is none right? This is beneath the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of every ordinary Traveller, who, if the way be difficult, reſolves to uſe the more Care and Diligence in finding it out, but never concludes with himſelf that there is no ſuch way, and no ſuch place as that which he intends to go. For a Man to argue from the multitude of Hereſies and Schiſms againſt the Truth of Religion, is as if he would prove, that becauſe there are ſo many <hi>Curve</hi> Lines, therefore there can be none <hi>Right;</hi> when for this very Reaſon we muſt conclude, that there is ſuch a thing as ſtreightneſs, or elſe
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:61773:628"/>there could be nothing crooked; for we can have no Notion of one without the other. And as all Obliquity ſuppoſes Rectitude, from which it declines, ſo Vice ſuppoſes Vertue, and Error ſuppoſes Truth, and Error in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion muſt ſuppoſe Truth in Religion. For whatever is contrary to any thing neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implies the Being of that to which it is contrary; and that which is not, can have nothing contrary to it. Nothing is more certain than it is, that if there were no Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, there could be no Vice; if no Truth, there could be no Error, and unleſs there were Truth and Excellency in Religion, it were impoſſible that there ſhould be any ſuch thing as Hereſie or Schiſm, which are other words for Error and Vice in matters of Religion. And it hath been already obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the worſt Hereſies give an occaſion to the clearing thoſe Points of Religion which are diſputed againſt, and ſo muſt be far from invalidating the Truth of it.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe theſe are things which ſome will not underſtand, or may be unwilling to acknowledge; and it is generally looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a ſure Argument of the weakneſs of any Cauſe, when thoſe that maintain it are not agreed about it amongſt themſelves; let us conſider, 1. That all Parties are agreed in the Truth of Religion in general, and of the Chriſtian Religion in particular: 2. That there is nothing beſides in which Men have
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:61773:628"/>not diſagreed, as well as in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. All Parties are agreed in the Truth of Religion in General. Even Hypocrites and Impoſtors ſo far own Religion, as to believe that it is worth the counterfeiting. For no Man counterfeits that which is not, no, nor that which has no Worth nor Excellency in it. No Man will be at much pains to be thought an Atheiſt, or an Infidel, who is not ſuch; and no Man will endeavour to be thought Vicious, unleſs he be ſo indeed. There are few pretenders to the Shame and Infamy which in Ages have been inſeparable from Irreligion; but it is the natural Senſe which Men have of Religion, that gives it ſo great Credit and Honour in a wicked World, that even the Shadow and Counterfeit of it has ſometimes too much prevailed.</p>
                     <p>But farther, all Sects and Parties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are agreed in the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, and the only difference amongſt them is concerning particular Doctrins and Opinions, that is, concerning the true Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Explication of it: And no Man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about the Meaning of that which they do not at the ſame time ſuppoſe to be. When any Point or Clauſe of a Law is in Diſpute, it would be ridiculous from thence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that no ſuch Law was ever made; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Parties muſt agree that there is ſuch a Law, or elſe there could be no diſpute
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:61773:629"/>about it. And when Differences ariſe in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it is an Argument for the Truth of Religion, becauſe there can be Difference about nothing, and Men would never differ about Religion, if it were not true, or they did not think it to be ſo.</p>
                     <p>But Chriſtians are not only agreed in the main that the Goſpel is true, but they are likewiſe agreed in the Senſe and Meaning of it, as to the Fundamental Articles neceſſary to Salvation. This was the ancient Rule and Meaſure laid down by <hi>Vincentius Liri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis,</hi> of the Catholick Doctrin neceſſary to be believed, that it had been believed in all Ages, in all Places, and in all Churches.

<pb n="553" facs="tcp:61773:629"/>which without all Controverſie are ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally received in the whole Chriſtian World, ſo much Truth is contained, as being joined with holy Obedience, may be ſufficient to bring a Man unto everlaſting Salvation. Neither have we cauſe to doubt but that as many as do walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Rule (neither overthrowing that which they have built, by ſuperinducing any damnable Hereſies thereupon, nor otherwiſe vitiating their Holy Faith with a lewd and wicked converſation) Peace ſhall be upon them, and Mercy, and upon the Iſrael of God.</hi> And he afterwards ſays, in relation to the Papiſts in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that he had <hi>ſometimes treated with thoſe of the oppoſite Party, and moved them, that howſoever in other things we did differ one from another, yet we ſhould join together in teaching thoſe main Points, the knowledge whereof was ſo neceſſary unto Salvation, and of the Truth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there was no Controverſie betwixt us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as to particular Controverſies, tho' one would imagin that wiſe Men of all others ſhould be leaſt apt to fall out about Words; yet it is an old Obſervation, that when learned and wiſe Men diſagree in Opinion, the Difference is commonly in the manner of expreſſing themſelves; or however it is generally about the manner of the Exiſtence, not about the Exiſtence, it ſelf, of Things. Thus what is better known by all than the Sun? and yet what Diſputes have there been, and ever will be concerning its Light, and
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:61773:630"/>Motion, and Diſtance, and Dimenſions?</p>
                     <p>But it ought likewiſe to be conſidered, that in the Management of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in Religion, ſuch as are otherwiſe good Men, are wont many times to be little fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable in repreſenting the Opinions of their Adverſaries; and if Men might be allowed to explain themſelves, and were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked and exaſperated beyond their own calmer Thoughts and Temper, the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in Religion would not be near ſo great, nor ſo many, as they now appear to be. It ſo happens in all Caſes, that Differences are widened by eager and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious Debates; Men ſpeak more than they deſigned, and then reſolve to defend what they have ſaid, ſo that Diſputes become endleſs, and are drawn out into Particulars without number, which were never at firſt thought of. Many Books of Controverſie are half taken up in asking croſs Queſtions, which perhaps neither of the Parties can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to ſatisfaction, nor do they often ſeem to deſign any thing farther, than to puzzle one another, and to be as captious and as troubleſom as they can. But this ought not to be imputed to the uncertainty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but to the perverſneſs of Men; and thoſe, who upon every occaſion fall into ſo great Heats and Contentions, muſt needs be very well aſſured of that in which they agree, that is, of the Truth of Religion in
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:61773:630"/>General, and of the Chriſtian Religion in Particular, as to the Fundamental Points of it. The Differences among Chriſtians may ſerve to prove to us Divine Authority of our Religion, and of the Scriptures, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, ſince Chriſtians agree in aſſerting their Divine Authority, and have never been ſo much at unity among themſelves, as to be able to agree to corrupt them, but have certainly delivered them down entire to us.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is not Religion only, which Men Diſpute about, but there is nothing beſides, in which they have not diſagreed. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that want of Experience and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the World, leads Men into more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies, than want of Parts and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And it is as certain, that a thorough Knowledge of the Debates and Contentions in Philoſophy, would ſooner cure moſt Men of their Infidelity, than any Arguments could do. Thoſe who raiſe Objections againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if they would but conſider, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every thing elſe has as great Difficulties, would be aſhamed to reject Religion upon Pretences, which, if they hold, muſt force them to reject all other things with it, and to believe juſt nothing at all. There have been Diſputes in all Ages concerning Light and Motion, the Wind and Seas, and other Wonders of Nature, but it would be abſurd for this Reaſon, to queſtion, whether there be any ſuch thing as Light and Motion, and
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:61773:631"/>whatever beſides Men have diſputed. And yet it is more abſurd, if it be poſſible, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that is a good Argument againſt Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but againſt nothing elſe. If the Sun yield his Light, and Nature go on in her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Courſe, tho' Men differ never ſo much in their Philoſophy about it, what can Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion be the worſe for their Diſputes? no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy thinks, that he ſees ever the leſs for any Difficulties, which have been urged concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Viſion; and why ſhould we be ever the leſs inclined to believe the Truth of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by reaſon of any Controverſies in it? Men may diſpute any thing, and there is hardly any thing but it has been diſputed; but nothing is the leſs credible for being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, unleſs it can be diſproved, but is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed and advanced by it. Truth, is nevertheleſs Truth for meeting with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but is the more tried, and the more approved, as Strength and Courage is by the ſharpeſt Conflicts.</p>
                     <p>Since then there will be Vices, as long as there are Men in this World, and Differences and Diſſentions in Religion, as long as there are Vices; ſince they cannot be hindered, but by the Omnipotent Power of God, and there are great Reaſons, why he ſhould not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to prevent them; ſince Differences in Religion are ſo far from implying any uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in Religion, that they rather prove a Confirmation of it, and are in divers reſpects
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:61773:631"/>made uſeful and expedient to the Edification of Chriſtians, it muſt be great inconſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and weakneſs, to produce them as an Objection againſt Religion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>There muſt be Hereſies,</hi> and <hi>the Spirit ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth expreſly that in the latter Times ſome ſhall depart from the Faith, giving heed to Seducing Spirits, and Doctrins of Devils, ſpeaking Lies in Hypocriſy, having their Conſcience ſeared with an hot Iron.</hi> 1 Tim. iv. 12. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could not be true, unleſs theſe things ſhould happen, which are foretold in ſeveral Places of Scripture. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſays our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>I have told you before,</hi> Matt. xxiv. 25. it ought to be no new nor ſurpriſing thing to Chriſtians, to ſee Hereſies ariſe, tho' they be never ſo wicked and abominable; becauſe we are forewarned to expect them, and they ſerve to give a kind of Teſtimony to the True Religion in fulfilling the Predictions of it. They help to prove the Religion, which they would deſtroy: For if there had been no Hereſies, that Religion could not be True, which has foretold them; but ſince there are Hereſies, our Religion is at leaſt ſo far true as to contain expreſs Prophecies concerning them, which we ſee daily fulfilled; and as they evidently prove our Religion true in this particular, ſo they invalidate it in no other. Which is the
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Juſt. Mart. Dial.</note> Anſwer that the Chriſtians anciently return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Enemies of Religion, when they made this <hi>Objection</hi> againſt it.</p>
                     <pb n="558" facs="tcp:61773:632"/>
                     <p>Let us follow the plain, the known, and and confeſſed Duties of Religion; Humility, Temperance, Righteouſneſs and Charity, and when once we have no Temptations to wiſh Religion untrue upon the account of the plain Precepts and Directions of it, we ſhall never ſuſpect it to be ſo, by reaſon of any Controverſies in it. For if Men will impartially conſider things; that Religion which has now For ſo many Ages ſtood out all the Aſſaults and Attempts, with Enemies from without, and Parties within could make againſt it, and has approved it much better, and more gloriouſly, than it could have done, if there never had been either Hereſies or Schiſms. <hi>Let us</hi> therefore <hi>hold faſt the Profeſſion of our Faith without Wavering,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſured, that the <hi>Gates of Hell,</hi> that is, all the Power and Stratagems of Satan, ſhall never be able to <hi>prevail againſt</hi> the Church of Chriſt, but ſhall only ſerve to add to its Victories, and adorn its Triumphs.

                     </head>
                     <p>ALL Objections, which can with any Colour or Pretence be alleged, have been conſidered, and anſwered, by divers Men of Great Learning and Judgment; and ſeveral Objections, which have made moſt noiſe in the World, as that about the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Ark, and others, have been De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to be groundleſs and frivolous. But tho' all Difficulties could not be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for, yet this would be no juſt or ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe, why we ſhould reject the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; becauſe Objections for the moſt part are impertinent to the Purpoſe, for which they were deſigned, and do not at all effect the Evidence, which is brought in proof of the Scriptures; and if they were pertinent, yet unleſs they could confute that Evidence, they ought not to determine us againſt them.</p>
                     <p>He that with an honeſt and ſincere Deſire to find out the Truth, or Falſhood, of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, enquires into it, ſhould firſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der impartially what can be alleged for it, and afterwards conſider the Objections raiſed againſt it, that ſo he may compare the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:61773:633"/>in proof of it, and the Objections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and determine himſelf on that ſide, which appears to have moſt Reaſon for it. But to inſiſt upon particular Objections, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of Difficult Places of Scripture, (tho' they would likewiſe obſerve the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, that have been given, which few of our Objectors have patience to do, but run away with the Objection without ſtaying for an Anſwer) I ſay to allege particular Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, without attending to the main Grounds and Motives, which induce a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Truth of the Scriptures, is a very deceitful way of Arguing: Becauſe it is not in the leaſt improbable, that there may be a true Revelation, which may have great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties in it. But if ſufficient Evidence be produced to convince us, that the Scriptures are indeed God's Word, and there be no proof on the contrary to invalidate that Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; then all the Objections beſides, that can be raiſed, are but Objections, and no more. For if thoſe Arguments by which our Religion appears to be True, remain ſtill in their full Force, notwithſtanding the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and no poſitive and direct Proof be brought, that they are inſufficient, we ought not to reject thoſe Arguments, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions deduced from them upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Objections, but to reject the Objections for the ſake of thoſe Arguments; becauſe if thoſe cannot be diſproved, all the
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:61773:633"/>which can be thought of, muſt proceed from ſome Miſtake. For when I am once aſſured of the Truth of a thing, by direct and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Proof, I have the ſame aſſurance, that all Objections againſt it muſt be vain and falſe, which I have, that that thing is true; becauſe every thing muſt be falſe, which is oppoſite to Truth, and nothing but that which takes off the Arguments, by which any thing is proved to be True, can ever prove it falſe: But all Objections muſt be falſe themſelves, or inſignificant to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for which they are alleged, if the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence for the Truth of that, againſt which they are brought, cannot be diſproved, that is, if the Thing, againſt which they are brought, be True.</p>
                     <p>To ſhew this in Particulars. If a Man muſter up never ſo many Inconſiſtencies, as he thinks, in the Scriptures, yet unleſs he be as well aſſured, at leaſt, that theſe which he calls Inconſiſtencies, cannot be in any Book of Divine Revelation; as he may be, that the Scriptures are of Divine Revelation, he cannot in Reaſon reject their Authority. And to be aſſured of this, it muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, what is inconſiſtent with the Evidence whereby the Authority of the Scriptures is proved to us: For whatever is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with this Evidence, cannot be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with their Authority. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as if a Man ſhould frame never ſo many
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:61773:634"/>Objections againſt the Opinion commonly received, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf wrote the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries</hi> which go under his Name, and not <hi>Julius Celſus,</hi> or any other Author; unleſs he can overthrow the Evidence by which <hi>Caeſar</hi> appears to be the Author of them, all his Objections will never amount to a Proof, that he was not the Author.</p>
                     <p>It is very poſſible for God to reveal things, which we may not be able to comprehend; and to enact Laws, eſpecially concerning the Rights and Ceremonies enjoined a People ſo many Ages paſt, the Reaſons whereof we may not be fully to underſtand; and it is very poſſible likewiſe, that there may be great Difficulties in Chronology, and that the Text may in divers places have a different Reading: And though all theſe things have been cleared to the ſatisfaction of reaſonable Men by ſeveral Expoſitors, yet let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at preſent to gratifie theſe Objectors (and this will gratifie them, if any thing can do it) that the Laws are utterly unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that the Difficulties in Chronology are no way adjuſted, that the divers Readings are by no means to be reconciled; yet what doth all this prove? That <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought no Miracles? That the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were not Witneſſes to them? That what the Prophets foretold did not come to paſs? That our Saviour never roſe from the Dead, and that the Holy Ghoſt did
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:61773:634"/>not deſcend upon the Apoſtles? Or that any thing is contained in the Scriptures repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Divine Attributes, or to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Notion of Good and Evil? Doth it prove any thing of all this, or can it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to prove it? If it cannot (and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more plain, than that it cannot) then all the Evidence produced in Proof of the Authority of the Scriptures ſtands firm, notwithſtanding all this mighty noiſe of the Obſcurity, and the Inconſiſtency, and the Uncertainty of the Text of the Scriptures. And the next enquiry naturally will be, not how the Scriptures can be from God, if theſe things be to be found in them (for it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved that they are from God, and therefore this muſt from henceforth be taken for granted, till it can be diſproved) but the only Enquiry will be, how theſe Paſſages are to be explained, or reconciled with other Places.</p>
                     <p>For let us conſider this way of Reaſoning, which is made uſe of to diſprove the Truth and Authority of the Scriptures in other things, and try whether we are wont to reaſon thus in any caſe, but that of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and whether we ſhould not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of this way of arguing in any other Caſe. How little is it that we throughly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in natural Things, and yet how ſeldom do we doubt of the Truth and Reality of them, becauſe we may puzzle and perplex our ſelves in the Explication of them? For
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:61773:635"/>inſtance, we diſcern the Light, and feel the Warmth and Heat of the Sun, and have the Experience of the conſtant returns of Day and Night, and of the ſeveral Seaſons of the Year; and no Man doubts but that all this is effected by the approach or withdrawing of the Sun's influence: But whoever will go about to explain all this, and to give a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Account of it, will find it a very hard Task; and ſuch Objections have been urged againſt every Hypotheſis in ſome Point or other, as perhaps no Man is able fully to anſwer. But doth any Man doubt whether there be ſuch a thing as Light and Heat, as Day and Night, though he cannot be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied whether the Sun or the Earth move? Or do Men doubt whether they can ſee or not, till they can demonſtrate how Viſion is made? And muſt none be allowed to ſee but Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians? Or do Men refuſe to eat, till they are ſatisfied how and after what manner they are nouriſh'd? Yet if we muſt be ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Objections, which do not come up to the main Point, nor affect the Truth and Reality of Things, but only fill our Minds with Scruples and Difficulties about them, we muſt believe nothing which we do not fully comprehend in every part and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it. For whatever we are ignorant of concerning it, that may, it ſeems, be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt the thing it ſelf, and may be a juſt Reaſon why we ſhould doubt of it. We muſt have a care of being too confident, that
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:61773:635"/>we move, before we can give an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Cauſe and Laws of Motion, which the greateſt Philoſophers have not been able to do; we muſt not preſume to eat, till we can tell how Digeſtion and Nouriſhment are made. In ſhort, this would run us into all the Extravagancies of Scepticiſm: For upon theſe Principles it was, that ſome doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether Snow be white, or Honey ſweet, or any thing elſe be of the ſame Colour or Taſt, which it appears to be of, becauſe they could amuſe themſelves with Difficulties, and they were too much Philoſophers to aſſent to any thing that they did not underſtand, tho' it were confirmed by the Senſe and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all Mankind. They were rational Men, and it was below them to believe their Senſes, unleſs their Reaſon were convinced, and that was too acute to be convinced, as long as any Difficulty, that could be ſtarted, remained unanſwered. And thus under the pretence of Reaſon and Philoſophy they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelves to the Scorn and Deriſion of all who had but the common Senſe of Men, without the Art and Subtilty of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon themſelves and others.</p>
                     <p>And it is the ſame thing in effect, as to matters of Religion. The Scriptures come confirmed down to us by all the ways of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, that the Authority of any Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation at this diſtance of time could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have, if it really were, what we
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:61773:636"/>believe the Scriptures to be. Why then do ſome Men doubt whether they be Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick? Can they diſprove the Arguments which are brought in defence of them? Can they produce any other Revelation more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick? Or is it more reaſonable to believe that God ſhould not reveal himſelf to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, than that this Revelation ſhould be his? No; this is not the caſe, but there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things to be found in the Scriptures, which they think would not be in them, if they were of Divine Revelation. But a wiſe Man will never disbelieve a thing for any Objections made againſt it, which do not reach the Point, nor touch theſe Arguments, by which it is proved to him. It is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent, that that may be moſt true, which may have many Exceptions framed againſt it, but it is abſurd to reject that as incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, which comes recommended by our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief by ſuch Evidence as cannot be diſprov'd. Till this be done, all which can be ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, only ſhews, that there are Difficulties to be met withal in the Scriptures, which was never denied by thoſe, who moſt firmly and ſtedfaſtly believe them.</p>
                     <p>But Difficulties can never alter the Nature of Things, and make that which is true to become falſe. There is no Science without its Difficulties, and it is not pretended that Theology is without them. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great and inexplicable Difficulties in the
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:61773:636"/>Mathematicks; but ſhall we therefore reject this as a Science of no Value nor Certainty, and believe no Demonſtration in <hi>Euclide</hi> to be true, unleſs we could Square the Circle? And yet this is every whit as reaſonable, as it is, not to acknowledge the Truth of the Scriptures, unleſs we could explain all the Viſions in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and the <hi>Revelations</hi> of St. <hi>John.</hi> We muſt believe nothing, and know nothing, if we muſt disbelieve and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject every thing which is liable to Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. We muſt not believe we have a Soul, unleſs we can give an account of all its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; nor that we have a Body, unleſs we can tell all the Parts and Motions, and the whole Frame and Compoſition of it. We muſt not believe our Senſes, till there is nothing relating to Senſation but what we perfectly underſtand; nor that there are any Objects in the World, till we know the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act manner how we perceive them, and can ſolve all Objections that may be raiſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them. And if a Man can be incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to this degree, it cannot be expected that he ſhould believe the Scriptures: But till he is come to this height of Folly and Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, if he will be conſiſtent with himſelf, and true to thoſe Principles of Reaſon, from which he argues in all other Caſes, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reject the Authority of the Scriptures upon the account of any Difficulties that he finds in them, whilſt the Arguments by
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:61773:637"/>which they are proved to be of Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, remain unanſwered. And all the Objections, which can be invented againſt the Scriptures, cannot ſeem near ſo abſurd to a conſidering Man, as to ſuppoſe that God ſhould not at all reveal himſelf to Mankind; or that the Heathen Oracles, or <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſhould be of Divine Revelation.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXXIV. <hi>The Concluſion; containing an Exhortation to a ſerious Conſideration of theſe things, both from the Example of the wiſeſt and moſt learned Men, and from the infinite Importance of the Things themſelves.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>AS Wiſe and as Learned Men as any that ever lived in the World, have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Belief of the Chriſtian Religion, when they had no Intereſt to engage them to it; and many of them have led their Lives under Peſecutions, and have at laſt been put to Death, rather than they would renounce that Faith which the Scriptures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to us. It cannot be denied but that there have been Men of as great Learning, and as great Numbers of them, profeſſing the Chriſtian Religion, as have been of all other
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:61773:637"/>Religions in the World: Indeed, all manner of Arts and Sciences have been more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by Chriſtians, than by all other ſorts of Men whatſoever; and all rational and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Learning is confined, as I may ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chriſtendom. For, beſides the Idolotrous Worſhip, and other Impieties notorious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, whatſoever Learning is to be found among the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> or other Heathen Nations, their Notions of Things, ſo far as they differ from what is contained in the Scriptures, are ſo obſcure and confuſed at the beſt, and ſo groundleſs, that that Chriſtian muſt be very weary of his Religion, who can think of changing it for ſuch Uncertainties.</p>
                     <p>And no Man that profeſs'd and called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Chriſtian ever disbelieved the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but there were viſibly other Reaſons for it than theſe, which the Nature of the Chriſtian Religion could afford: It was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in his Life, that he wiſhed the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion were falſe, before he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to perſuade himſelf that it is not true. Some are poſſeſs'd with that intolerable Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Pride and Contradiction, that meer Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and a Conceit of being wiſer than others makes them find fault with any thing that is generally received; and the greateſt Fault which theſe Man can find with the Chriſtian Religion is, that they have been bred up in it, and therefore they make heavy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the prejudices of Education, and
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:61773:638"/>the hindrances which ingenuous Minds la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under, from the influences of it, in the purſuit of Truth: And theſe Men perhaps might have talk'd as much, and to as much purpoſe, for Chriſtianity, as they now talk againſt it, if they had not been Born among Chriſtians, and been bred up in the Chriſtian Religion; they ſcorn to be the better for their Education, and are aſhamed of nothing more than to believe and think like other Men; and they might almoſt be perſuaded to be Chriſtians ſtill, if they could but be ſingular in being ſo: For the mere Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Singularity makes them diſpiſe and diſpute againſt any thing which others allow and eſteem. But it will be hard to find any learned Man of tolerable Modeſty and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and who was not as ſingular in other things, and in his Notions of Religion, but he has firmly believed the Divine Authority of the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>It concerns all, who have any Doubts about theſe things, to weigh the Objections with the Anſwers that have been given to them by divers Authors, and withal to obſerve the importance of the Objections, and how far they affect the main Cauſe; and ſtill to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that it is at every Man's own Peril, if he make a raſh and partial Judgment. If our Faith could be of no Benefit or Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to us, nor Infidelity any Prejudice, we might take the ſame Liberty to give Credit
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:61773:638"/>or no Credit to what we read in the Bible, that we uſe in the Reading all other Books, and to receive or reject it as we think fit, or to believe only juſt ſo much, as lies even with our own Underſtandings and Notions of Things, and at the worſt this would be but Folly in us. But it is madneſs to reject our own Happineſs, and make our ſelves miſerable, becauſe we do not perceive the Reaſons of all the Means and Methods, which God has been pleaſed to uſe to make us happy; or are not able to underſtand every Word of that Book, which contains the Terms of our Salvation.</p>
                     <p>This is as if a Son ſhould chuſe to live mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably, rather than to enjoy a large Eſtate left him by his Father, becauſe he doth not perceive the deſign and full meaning of every particular in his Will; he ſearches out for all Ways and Arts for cavilling at it, and is fond of any pretence to caſt it aſide as Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, being reſolved never to believe it to be his Father's; For his Father was a wiſe Man, and if it were his, ſuch and ſuch Clauſes would not be in it, ſince there is no reaſon, that he can ſee, why they ſhould be inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; ſeveral things mentioned in it, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves are miſ-timed, the Bounds of the Lands are not deſcribed by fit Names; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it is interlined, and he never will accept of ſuch an Eſtate conveyed to him by ſuch a Will; but chuſes rather to be miſerable all
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:61773:639"/>the Days of his Life. This would be ſuch peeviſhneſs and perverſneſs, as is not to be met withal, where our Temporal Intereſt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: But too many are too forward to reject the Tenders, and deſpiſe the Terms of an everlaſting Inheritance in Heaven, tho' at the ſame time they become obnoxious to all the Curſes threatned to Unbelievers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Old and New Teſtament contain ſome things which may afford matter of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and Cavil to captious Men.</p>
                     <p>God has ſent his Prophets to call, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh us, and his Son, to reconcile us to himſelf, by his Death; and to offer us E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Peace and Happineſs, and he has giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us all the Evidence of it, that the nature of the things would admit. The <hi>Jews</hi> have aſſerted the Authority of the Old Teſtament from the times of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets; and the Chriſtians aſſerted the Truth of the Goſpel, when it was impoſſible for them not to know whether it were true or not; without any proſpect of Advantage by it in this World; but with a certain expectation of all manner of Torments and Deaths; and the greateſt part of the Known World, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Belief of it, and became Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; when in this World, Chriſtians were <hi>of all Men the moſt miſerable,</hi> and were ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by the ſtedfaſt hope and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Happineſs which is promiſed to us in the Scriptures after this Life. And all
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:61773:639"/>things conſidered, we have as ſufficient Grounds for the Authority of the Scriptures, as we have, not only that any other Book was compoſed by the Author, whoſe Name it bears, but as we have to believe any thing elſe in the World. Now what do theſe Men? How do they receive ſo great a Bleſſing? Why, they overlook all the Evidence that can be brought to prove the Divine Authority of the Scriptures, and ſearch up and down for doubtful and obſcure Paſſages to diſprove it by; not conſidering in the mean time, that nothing can overthrow their Authority, but that which can invalidate the Evidence, by which it is eſtabliſh'd. It would be the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Folly and Ingratitude thus to deſpiſe God's Mercy and Care over us, if there were no danger in it, but it being a thing of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Danger, it is no leſs than Madneſs: For what milder Term can be found to expreſs the deſperate Folly of them, who reject a Book, which ſets before us the means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but at the ſame time forewarns us upon pain of the ſevereſt effects of God's Diſpleaſure, not to neglect them: It is mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I ſay, if we rightly conſider it, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſuch a Book, and at once both to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the Mercy, and deſpiſe the Threatnings of the infinitely Merciful, and the infinitely Great and Powerful God.</p>
                     <p>It is a good Caution to the Atheiſt to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear his Blaſphemies, and Contempt of the
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:61773:640"/>Divine Majeſty, for fear it ſhould prove true, that there is a God, at laſt, and then it will be a diſmal thing after all his profane Talking and Arguing to be called before that God, whom he has ſo often denied. And it is as good Advice to thoſe, who make it their buſineſs to find Fault with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to conſider ſeriouſly whether they are ſure that theſe are not God's Word, after all that can be ſaid againſt them; and if they be not abſolutely certain of this, the Name and Title, which they bear, and which Men as wiſe and as Judicious as themſelves, thought to belong to them, ſhould methinks keep Men within ſome bounds of Modeſty, and Diſcretion. For if they be indeed the Word of God (and nothing is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made more evident) than how dearly muſt they pay for a little cavilling Wit and Subtilty! The beſt and moſt Divine things may be deſpiſed and affronted by a bold and Scurrilous Wit, but can Men think it a ſafe or a prudent thing to ridicule and Scoff at thoſe Books, which, for ought they know, may be of Divine Revelation, when all the Reaſon, of which they fanſie themſelves ſo great Maſters, can never be able to confute the Arguments brought in Vindication of them? Can they value the contemptible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a little Satyr and Drollery, at that mighty Rate, as to run the hazard of being damned for it?</p>
                     <pb n="575" facs="tcp:61773:640"/>
                     <p>If Men have any real Doubts or Scruples, they muſt needs grant, that it is too ſerious a thing to jeſt and trifle withal, when no leſs than the Terms of our everlaſting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, or everlaſting Miſery is the thing in Controverſy. And what Wit there may be in it, I cannot tell; but I am ſure it is no ſign of a very Wiſe Man to ſpeak contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of a Book, by which he can never prove, but that he muſt be judged at the laſt Day. <hi>As a Mad-Man,</hi> ſays Solomon, <hi>who caſteth Fire-brands, Arrows, and Death; ſo is the Man that deceiveth his Neighbour, and ſaith, Am not I in Sport?</hi> Prov. xxvi. 18, 19. But what Deſcription or Compariſon can be found equal to his Madneſs, who deceiveth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth himſelf, and that Eternally, and yet ſays, Am not I in Sport? Is not this the very perfection of Wit and Raillery?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wo unto him, that Striveth with his Maker</hi> Iſai. xlv. 9. <hi>Do they provoke me to anger, ſaith the Lord, do they not provoke themſeves to the Confuſion of their own Faces?</hi> Jer. vii. 19. <hi>And thou ſhalt know, that I am the Lord, and that I have heard all thy Blaſphemies. Thus with your Mouth ye have boaſted againſt me, and have Multiplied your Words againſt me, I have heard them,</hi> Ezek. xxxv. 12, 13. <hi>Do we provoke the Lord to Jealouſy, are we ſtronger than he?</hi> 1 Cor. x. 22.</p>

If all that I have diſcourſed be inſufficient to convince theſe Men; yet let their own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and even their own Blaſphemies convince them; for the very worſt that they can ſay or do, ſerves to fulfil the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and confirm the Authority of the Holy Scriptures.</p>

<pb n="580" facs="tcp:61773:643"/>Prophets, and other Holy and famous Men from the Dead, and that he ſhould bring down <hi>Manna</hi> for them from Heaven. In their Old Writings and Records, he ſays, they ſpeak much of theſe Two things of their Expectation. I am inclined to believe that theſe Traditions, if they had been right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, were not ſo blind and fooliſh, as that Learned Author Stiles them, but had reſpect to the very Time and Occaſion, to which our Saviour refers the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they required theſe Signs of him. For at his Reſurrection <hi>many Bodies of Saints, which Slept, aroſe, Matt.</hi> xxvii. 52. And ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them of the <hi>Manna,</hi> or Bread which came down from Heaven, he puts them in Mind of his Aſcenſion: <hi>What, and if ye ſhall ſee the Son of Man aſcend up where he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?</hi> Joh. vi. 62. Whereby he intimates, that then would be the time of ſending this <hi>Manna,</hi> when upon his Aſcenſion, he would beſtow the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt. The time was not yet come for theſe Miracles to be wrought, they were not to be wrought at their Demand; it was ſufficient that they had Intimations given to expect them, and in the mean time they ought to have been contented with others.</p>

<pb n="581" facs="tcp:61773:643"/>both in the Speculation, and in the Practice of it ſhould not alſo be of the Chriſtian Faich, eſpecially, if he owned, that a ſignal Miracle was by the Prayers of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, obtained for the deliverance of himſelf, and his whole Army,
